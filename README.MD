# Hydejack
Hydejack is a cutting-edge Jekyll theme that combines the best of static sites and modern web apps.
It features a suite of JavaScript that makes the page feel like an app, without sacrificing backwards-compatibility,
page-load speed or SEO.

> Your presence on the web — A [blog], a [portfolio] and a [resume].

It aims to be the complete package for professionals on the web.
It features a blog suitable for both prose and technical documentation,
a showcase for projects and a resume that fits with the rest of the design.
