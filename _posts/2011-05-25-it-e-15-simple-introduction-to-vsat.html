<p>What is VSAT ? VSAT stands for Very Small Aperture Terminal//it's a catchy acronym</p>
<p>and as such it's been adopted by all and sundry for every type of satellite product from small   <br />components of a system to complete systems. Because the term really hinges around the small size    <br />of the antenna it has been used to describe both one-way and interactive systems. Specifically, we    <br />in the industry, isolate television broadcast receivers because counting these as well would simply    <br />distort the numbers in the marketplace, but data, audio and, to some extent, voice systems are    <br />included. Generally, these systems operate in the Ku-band and C-band frequencies. As a rule of    <br />thumb C-band (which suffers less from rain attenuation, but requires larger antennas) is used in    <br />Asia, Africa and Latin America whilst Ku-band (which can use smaller antennas, but suffers from    <br />rain fade in a monsoon-like downpour) is used in Europe and North America. Typically, interactive    <br />Ku-band antenna sizes range from 75 centimetres to 1.8 metres and C-band from 1.8 metres to 2.4    <br />metres. One way systems can use antennas as small as 45 centimetres.    <br />What does a network look like? VSAT networks come in various shapes and sizes ranging    <br />from star data system users with one site connected to an operator's shared hub to many    <br />thousands based on a dedicated facilitylocated at their own site. Mesh systems have traditionally    <br />been somewhat smaller in size than star systems//5 to 30 sites used to be a good rule of thumb    <br />- but the average size of orders has risen as prices have come down and some rural telephony    <br />networks now comprise as many as several hundred or even thousands of sites.    <br />What is One-way Satellite ? One way systems rely on a transmitting station which    <br />transmits one or more carriers to the satellite which re-broadcasts the signal over its coverage    <br />area. All receive-only VSATs under the satellite footprint can then receive the signal or the    <br />user/operator is able to define groups of VSATs from one to all on the network. Broadcast    <br />systems are used for data and audio. The most popular application for data is the transmission of    <br />financial feeds//Reuters, Telerate and KnightRidder are good examples of companies with    <br />large data broadcasting networks//however, there are many other uses, such as software    <br />downloads, file transfers, transmission of press agency news items (with pictures) and the    <br />broadcast of paging messages for terrestrial transmission to the pagers themselves.    <br />Who uses VSAT ? You name it really, car dealerships, gas stations, lottery systems, banks,    <br />insurance companies, drug stores, general stores, supermarkets, healthcare companies, manufacturers,    <br />couriers, hotel chains, car rental businesses, food manufacturers, heavy industries, mines, electrical    <br />utilities, oil and gas pipelines, energy production and exploration, timbercompanies, plantations,    <br />various government departments and agencies ... any others you can think of, just add to the list.</p>
