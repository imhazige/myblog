<p>For most types of graphics file formats currently available the answer is &quot;no&quot;. A virus (or   <br />worm, Trojan horse, and so forth) is fundamentally a collection of code (that is, a program) that    <br />contains instructions which are executed by a CPU. Most graphics files, however, contain only    <br />static data and no executable code. The code that reads, writes, and displays graphics data is    <br />found in translation and display programs and not in the graphics files themselves. If reading or    <br />writing a graphics file caused a system malfunction is it most likely the fault of the program    <br />reading the file and not of the graphics file data itself.    <br />With the introduction of multimedia we have seen new formats appear, and modifications to    <br />older formats made, that allow executable instructions to be stored within a file format. These    <br />instructions are used to direct multimedia applications to play sounds or music, prompt the user</p>
<p>for information, or display other graphics and video information. And such multimedia display   <br />programs may perform these functions by interfacing with their environment via an API, or by    <br />direct interaction with the operating system. One might also imagine a truly object-oriented    <br />graphics file as containing the code required to read, write, and display itself.    <br />Once again, any <font color="#0000ff">catastrophes</font> that result from using these multimedia application is most    <br />like the result of unfound bugs in the software and not some <font color="#0000ff">sinister</font> instructions in the graphics    <br />file data. Such &quot;logic bombs&quot; are typically <font color="#0000ff">exorcised</font> through the use of testing using a wide    <br />variety of different image files for test cases.    <br />If you have a virus scanning program that indicates a specific graphics file is infected by    <br />virus, then it is very possible that the file <font color="#0000ff">coincidentally </font>contains a byte pattern that the scanning    <br />programming recognizes as a key byte signature identifying a virus. Contact the author (or even    <br />read the documentation!) of the virus scanning program to discuss the probability of the    <br />mis-identification of a clean file as being infected by a virus. Save the graphics file, as the author    <br />will most likely wish to examine it as well.    <br />If you suspect a graphics file to be at the heart of a virus problem you are experiencing, then    <br />also consider the possibility that the graphics file's transport mechanism (floppy disk, tape or    <br />shell archive file, compressed archive file, and so forth) might be the original source of the virus    <br />and not the graphics file itself.</p>
