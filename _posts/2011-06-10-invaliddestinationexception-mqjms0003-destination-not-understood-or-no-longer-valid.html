<p>javax.jms.InvalidDestinationException:                <br />MQJMS0003: Destination not understood or no longer valid.                </p>
<p>Which of the following could have caused this error?                </p>
<p>A. The JMS destination requires IIOP protocol for access. The JMS client is using the default JMS message protocol.                <br />B. The JMS destination is running on a non-WebSphere environment.                <br />C. The JMS destination was accidentally deleted.                <br />D. The JNDI binding to the destination was changed.                <br />E. The JMS destination is listening on a non standard TCP port.                <br />me: http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY60708                <br />PROBLEM SUMMARY:                <br />This problem is caused by using JMS interfaces to access MQ JMS                <br />classes (i.e. casting a com.ibm.mq.MQQueue to a                <br />javax.jms.Queue).                </p>
<p>The use of an (instanceof MQQueue) test was returning false                <br />when an MQQueue object had been cast as a javax.jms.Queue. The                <br />logic then treated this as an invalid object, and threw an                <br />InvalidDestinationException.                </p>
<p>②=======================================================================================                <br />MQJMS0003&#160;&#160;&#160; Destination not understood or no longer valid.                </p>
<p>Explanation: The queue or topic may have become unavailable, the application may be using an incorrect connection for the queue or topic, or the                 </p>
<p>supplied destination is not of the correct type for this method.                <br />User Response: Check that WebSphere MQ is still running and the queue manager is available. Check that the right connection is being used for your                 </p>
<p>queue or topic.                 </p>
<p>③=======================================================================================                <br />The problem is the IBM class com.ibm.mq.jms.MQSession.createQSender has the following code                </p>
<p>**************************************************************************************************************************************************                <br />if(!(queue instanceof com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueue))                <br />{                <br />String s1 = &quot;MQJMS0003&quot;;                <br />String s3 = ConfigEnvironment.getErrorMessage(s1);                <br />s3 = s3 + buildExceptionString(queue);                <br />InvalidDestinationException invaliddestinationexception = new InvalidDestinationException(s3, s1);                <br />throw invaliddestinationexception;                <br />}                <br />mqqueue = (com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueue)queue;                <br />mqqueue1 = getServicesMgr().getOutputQueue(mqqueue, this);                <br />}                <br />**************************************************************************************************************************************************                <br />At first all looks straight for ward but there is a bigger problem.                </p>
<p>instanceOf operator of java would return false for objects of the same class if they are being loaded by different classloaders.                </p>
<p>In my case i had many webapplications and the Queue object was got by a jndi lookup. Now when first time this code is executed it all works fine                 </p>
<p>for a application but when you start using anohter web application the same code fails and throws the InvalidDestinationException .                </p>
<p>The reason being the 2 objects on which ibm code is doing instanceof are loaded by different classloaders.                </p>
<p>The Solution to this problem is delete all the ibm jars (com.ibm.mq.jar and com.ibm.mqjms.jar) from individual web application and add these in                 </p>
<p>the servers lib directory. Now all instances are loaded by the server classloader and not by webappclassloaders .                </p>
<p>This is a criptic issue which took me 2 days to figure out.                </p>
<p>wfac错误原因：                <br />配置的factory和destination是两个不同的实现,factory指向的是WAS MQ,而queue指向的是sonic MQ,所以出现此报错。                </div>
