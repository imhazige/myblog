<p>(1) Have you heard the hypeabout the wireless Web?   <br />Either way, WAP an acronym for wireless application protocol is making the wireless    <br />Internet a reality, and even if it isn't successful right now, this industry is expecting enormous    <br />growth. Market researcher IDC predicts that 1.3 billion wireless Internet users will have    <br />WAP-enabled devices by 2004.    <br />(2) Where did WAP come from?    <br />An industry consortium called the WAP Forum promotes WAP. The WAP forum was    <br />founded in 1997 by Ericson, Motorola, Nokia and Phone.com after Phone.com developed a    <br />server and browser for AT&amp;T's PocketNet.    <br />(3) What exactly is WAP    <br />WAP is a set of protocols used to transfer data to wireless devices. WAP-enabled devices    <br />provide wireless users with a limited version of the Web designed to work on the small black and</p>
<p>white screens of phones and PADs.   <br />Websites accessed by WAP phones must be re-written to satisfy the wireless application    <br />protocol; in order to do that, Web pages written in HTML must be transferred to the WAP    <br />markup language (WML). Internet browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer read pages in    <br />HTML, while a micro-browser on a WAP-enabled device reads pages in WML.    <br />Major websites like Yahoo and Amazon.com have carefully designed their WAP sites to    <br />look and feel much like their wired counterparts, while search engines like Google are    <br />transferring pages from HTML to WML so they can be accessed by wireless users.    <br />(4) What's the problem with WAP    <br />WAP faces bandwidth constraints that limit the amount of data that can be transferred to the    <br />devices. On the wireless Internet, users are presented with a fraction of information available on    <br />the traditional version.    <br />And while WAP is the leading wireless protocol now, that doesn't mean that isn't here to    <br />stay. When a better version of the wireless Web becomes available, WAP could very well    <br />become obsolete.    <br />One potential competitor is NTT DoCoMo, a Japanese company which has developed a    <br />hugely successful wireless data service called i-mode and expects to tap the U.S. market toward    <br />the end of 2001.    <br />Blue-tooth is a technology that connects electronic devices from camcorders to PDAs to    <br />computers without using wires. Consumers began to see Bluetooth in action when Toshiba    <br />starting selling a Bluetooth-enabled PC card over their website in September 2000 for $199.    <br />Other vendors plan to follow with devices ranging from PDAs to mobile phones.    <br />A Bluetooth device uses radio signal to send information from one Bluetooth device to    <br />another though the air. For example, if you are trying to transfer a PC's address book to a PDA,    <br />first the data in an address book is translated into a language that the PDA can understand by a    <br />conduit. The data goes through the conduit to the Bluetooth device. The Bluetooth device is made    <br />up of a base-band processor, a radio, and an antenna. The base-band processor transfers the data    <br />into signals that the radio can understand, and the radio puts out signals in a frequency (2.4    <br />gigahertz) that the antenna transmits through the air to another Bluetooth device within 30-feet.    <br />The other device receives the data and processes it in the reverse order.    <br />Bluetooth is supported by a Special Interest Group (SIG), which was founded in 1998 and    <br />has approximately 2000 members, all of whom have access to Bluetooth specifications the    <br />information needed to make a Bluetooth product. The SIG includes IBM, Intel, Microsoft and    <br />Nokia, and works to develop and promote the Blue-tooth technology.    <br />But Bluetooth, like many new technologies, may not be an instant hit. There are still plenty    <br />of questions about the ability of these devices to speak the same language. So while devices    <br />produced by the same company could communicate with each other easily, integration may be</p>
<p>difficult when multiple vendors are involved. And while consultants at Forrester Research expect   <br />Bluetooth’s popularity to grow, the firm said in a brief that many businesses won't buy in, &quot;until    <br />user pressure forces them to in 2003“</p>
