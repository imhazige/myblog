<p>Computer network is a system connecting two or more computers. A computer network allows   <br />user to exchange data quickly, access and share resources including equipments, application software,    <br />and information.    <br />Data communications systems are the electronic systems that transmit data over communications    <br />lines from one location to another. You might use data communications through your microcomputer    <br />to send information to a friend using another computer. You might work for an organization whose    <br />computer system is spread throughout a building, or even throughout the country or world. That is, all    <br />the parts—input and output units, processor, and storage devices—are in different places and linked    <br />by communications. Or you might use telecommunications lines—telephone lines—to tap into    <br />information located in an outside data bank. You could then transmit it to your microcomputer for    <br />your own reworking and analysis.    <br />To attach to a network, a special-purpose hardware component is used to handle all the    <br />transmission. The hardware is called a network adapter card or network interface card (NIC), it is    <br />a printed circuit board plugged into a computer's bus, and a cable connects it to a network    <br />medium.    <br />Communications networks differ in geographical size. There are three important types:    <br />LANs, MANs, and WANs.    <br />Local Area Networks </p>
<p>Networks with computers and peripheral devices in close physical   <br />proximity—within the same building, for instance—are called local area networks (LANs).    <br />Linked by cable-telephone, coaxial, or fiber optic. LANs often use a bus form organization. In a    <br />LAN, people can share different equipments, which lower the cost of equipments. LAN may be    <br />linked to other LANs or to larger networks by using a network gateway. With the gateway, one    <br />LAN may be connected to the LAN of another LAN of another office group. It may also be    <br />connected to others in the wide world, even if their configurations are different. Alternatively, a    <br />network bridge would be used to connect networks with the same configurations.    <br />There is a newly development for LANs: WLAN. A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a flexible    <br />data communication system implemented as an extension to, or as an alternative for, a wired    <br />LAN within a building or campus. Using electromagnetic waves, WLANs transmit and receive    <br />data over the air, minimizing the need for wired connections. Thus, WLANs combine data    <br />connectivity with user mobility, and, through simplified configuration, enable movable LANs.    <br />Over the recent several years, WLANs have gained strong popularity in a number of vertical    <br />markets, including the health-care, retail, manufacturing, warehousing, and academic arenas.    <br />[1]These industries have profited from the productivity gains of using hand-held terminals and    <br />notebook computers to transmit real-time information to centralized hosts for processing. Today</p>
<p>WLANs are becoming more widely recognized as a general-purpose connectivity alternative for   <br />a broad range of business customers.    <br />Applications for Wireless LANs [2]Wireless LANs frequently augment rather than replace    <br />wired LAN networks—often providing the final few meters of connectivity between a backbone    <br />network and the mobile user. The following list describes some of the many applications made    <br />possible through the power and flexibility of wireless LANs:    <br />Doctors and nurses in hospitals are more productive because hand-held or notebook    <br />computers with wireless LAN capability deliver patient information instantly.    <br />Consulting or accounting audit engagement teams or small workgroups increase productivity    <br />with quick network setup.    <br />Network managers in dynamic environments minimize the overhead of moves, adds,    <br />and changes with wireless LANs, thereby reducing the cost of LAN ownership.    <br />Training sites at corporations and students at universities use wireless connectivity to    <br />facilitate access to information, information exchanges, and learning.    <br />Network managers installing networked computers in older buildings find that wireless    <br />LANs are a cost-effective network infrastructure solution.    <br />Retail store owners use wireless networks to simply frequent network reconfiguration.    <br />Trade show and branch office workers minimize setup requirements by installing preconfigured    <br />wireless LANs needing no local MIS support.    <br />Warehouse workers use wireless LANs to exchange information with central databases and    <br />increase their productivity.    <br />Network managers implement wireless LANs to provide backup for mission-critical    <br />applications running on wired networks.    <br />Senior executives in conference rooms make quicker decisions because they have real-time    <br />information at their fingertips.    <br />The increasingly mobile user also becomes a clear candidate for a wireless LAN. Portable    <br />access to wireless networks can be achieved using laptop computers and wireless NICs. This    <br />enables the user to travel to various locations–meeting rooms, hallways, lobbies, cafeterias,    <br />classrooms, etc.–and still have access to their networked data. Without wireless access, the user    <br />would have to carry clumsy cabling and find a network tap to plug into.    <br />Metropolitan Area Networks </p>
<p>These networks are used as links between office buildings in   <br />a city. Cellular phone systems expand the flexibility of MAN by allowing links to car phones and    <br />portable phones.    <br />Wide Area Networks </p>
<p>Wide area networks are countrywide and worldwide networks.   <br />Among other kinds of channels, they use microwave relays and satellites to reach users over long    <br />distances. One of the most widely used WANs is Internet, which allows users to connect to other    <br />users and facilities worldwide.</p>
