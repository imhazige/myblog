<p>What is a secure network? Can an Internet be made secure?[1] Although the concept of a   <br />secure network is <font color="#0000ff">appealing</font> to most users, networks cannot be classified simply as secure or not    <br />secure because the term is not absoluteeach group defines the level of access that is permitted    <br />or denied. For example, some organizations store data that is valuable. Such organizations define    <br />a secure network to be a system prevents outsiders from accessing the organization's computers.    <br />Other organizations need to make information available to outsiders, but prohibit outsiders from    <br />changing the data. Such organizations may define a secure network as one that allows arbitrary    <br />access to data, but includes mechanisms that prevent unauthorized changes. Finally, many large    <br />organizations need a complex definition of security that allows access to selected data or services    <br />the organization chooses to make public, while preventing access or modification of sensitive    <br />data and services that are kept private.    <br />Because no absolute definition of information secure exists, the first step an organization    <br />must take to achieve a secure system is to define the organization's security policy. The policy    <br />does not specify how to achieve protection. Instead, it states clearly and unambiguously the items    <br />that are to be protected.</p>
<p>Defining an information security policy is complex. The primary complexity arises because an   <br />information security policy cannot be separated from the security policy for computer systems    <br />attached to the network. In particular, defining a policy for data that traverses a network does not    <br />guarantee that data will be secure. Information security cannot prevent unauthorized users who    <br />have accounts on the computer from obtaining a copy of the data. The policy must hold for the data    <br />stored on disk, data communicated over a telephone line with a dialup modem, information printed    <br />on paper, data transported on portable media such as a floppy disk, and data communicated over a    <br />computer network.    <br />Defining a security policy is also complicated because each organization must decide which    <br />aspects of protection are most important, and often must compromise between security and ease    <br />of use. For example, an organization can consider:    <br /> Data Integrity'    <br /> Data Availability'    <br /> Data Confidentiality and Privacy.</p>
