<p>The techniques developed to protect single computers and network-linked computer systems   <br />from accidental or intentional harm are called computer security. Such harm includes destruction    <br />of computer hardware and software, physical loss of data, and the deliberate <font color="#0000ff">invasion</font> of    <br />databases by unauthorized individuals.    <br />Data may be protected by such basic methods as locking up terminals and replicating data in    <br />other storage facilities. Most <font color="#0000ff">sophisticated</font> methods include limiting data access by requiring the    <br />user to have an encoded card or to supply an identification number or password. Such procedures    <br />can apply to the computer-data system as whole or may be <font color="#0000ff">pinpointed</font> for particular information    <br />banks or programs. Data are frequently ranked in computer files according to degree of    <br />confidentiality.    <br />Operating systems and programs may also incorporate built-in safeguards, and data may be    <br />encoded in various ways to prevent unauthorized persons from interpreting or even copying the    <br />material. The encoding system most widely user in the United States is the Data Encryption    <br />Standard (DES) designed by IBM and approved for use by the National Institute of that are then    <br />repeated several times. Very large-scale computer systems, for example, the U.S. military's    <br />Advanced Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET), may be broken up into smaller    <br />subsystems for security purposes, but smaller system in government and industry are more prone to    <br />system-wide invasions. At the level of personal computers, security possibilities are fairly minimal.    <br />Most invasions of computer systems are for international or corporate spying or <font color="#0000ff">sabotage</font>,    <br />but computer hackers may take the <font color="#0000ff">penetration</font> of protected databanks as a challenge, often with</p>
<p>no object in mind other than accomplishing a technological feat. Of growing concern is the   <br />deliberate <font color="#0000ff">implantation </font>in computer programs of worms or viruses that, if undetected, may    <br />progressively destroy databases and other software. Such infected programs have appeared in the    <br />electronic bulletin boards available to computer users. Other viruses have been incorporated into    <br />computer software sold commercially. No real protection is available against such bugs except    <br />the <font color="#0000ff">vigilance</font> of manufacturer and user.</p>
