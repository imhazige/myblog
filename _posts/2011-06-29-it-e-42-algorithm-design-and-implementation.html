<p>This course introduces a set of fundamental design principles and problem-solving techniques   <br />for the construction and implementation of computer algorithms. Problem solutions are developed    <br />in a design language such as Pseudocode and then coded in a high-level structured programming    <br />language. (Consult the Computer Science Department for the language currently in use.) Topics    <br />such as problem specification, top-down design with <font color="#0000ff">stepwise</font> refinement, standard data types,    <br />control structures, subprograms, modular design, and parameter passing are presented through a    <br />study of specific example algorithms. Style, documentation, solution robustness, and conformance    <br />with specifications are emphasized throughout.    <br />Prerequisites: High school algebra I &amp; II.</p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to present a coherent set of tools and techniques for the   <br />development of computer solutions to simple problems in data manipulation and report    <br />generation. Upon completion of the course, a student should be able to: analyze a problem    <br />statement for completeness and <font color="#0000ff">clarity</font>; use the method of top-down, modular, structured design    <br />to develop a hierarchy chart (structure chart) and a set of Pseudocode modules for a problem    <br />solution; convert this solution into source code in the designated high-level language in    <br />accordance with a well-defined set of style rules; debug and test the program; and provide clear    <br />documentation for the result.</p>
