<p>A programming language is a defined set of instructions that are used to make a computer   <br />perform a specific task. Written using a defined vocabulary the programming language is either    <br />complied or interpreted by the computer into the machine    <br />language that is understood by the processor.    <br />There are several types of programming languages, the    <br />most common are:    <br />High-level Languages these are written using terms    <br />and vocabulary that can be understood and written in a</p>
<p>similar manner to human language. [1] They are called high-level languages because they remove   <br />many of the complexities involved in the raw machine language that computers understand. The    <br />main advantage of high-level languages over low-level languages is that they are easier to read,    <br />write, and maintain. All high-level languages must be compiled at some stage into machine    <br />language. The first high-level programming languages were designed in the 1950s. Now there are    <br />dozens of different languages, including BASIC, COBOL, C, C++, FORTRAN and Pascal.    <br />Scripting Languages like high-level languages, scripting languages are written in manner    <br />similar to human language. Generally, scripting languages are easier to write than high-level    <br />languages and are interpreted rather compiled into machine language. Scripting languages, which    <br />can be embedded within HTML, commonly are used to add functionality to a Web page, such as    <br />different menu styles or graphic displays, or to serve dynamic advertisements. These types of    <br />languages are client-side scripting languages, affecting the data that the end user sees in a    <br />browser window. Other scripting languages are server-side scripting languages that manipulate    <br />the data, usually in a database, on the server. Scripting languages came about largely because of    <br />the development of the Internet as a communications tool. Some examples of scripting languages    <br />include VBScript, JavaScript, ASP and Perl.    <br />Assembly Language assembly language is as close as possible to writing directly in    <br />machine language. Due to the low level nature of assembly language, it is tied directly to the type    <br />of processor and a program written for one type of CPU generally will not run on another.    <br />Machine language The lowest-level programming language. Machine languages are the only    <br />languages understood by computers. While easily understood by computers, machine languages are    <br />almost impossible for humans to use because they consist entirely of numbers. Programmers,    <br />therefore, use either a high-level programming language or an assembly language. An assembly    <br />language contains the same instructions as a machine language, but the instructions and variables    <br />have names instead of being just numbers.    <br />Programs written in high-level languages are translated into assembly language or machine    <br />language by a compiler. Assembly language programs are translated into machine language by a    <br />program called an assembler.    <br />Every CPU has its own unique machine language. Programs must be rewritten or recompiled,    <br />therefore, to run on different types of computers.    <br />For now, let's talk about some high level languages very briefly, which are used by professional    <br />programmers in the current mainstream software industry.    <br />· C    <br />This is probably the most widely-used, and definitely the oldest, of the three languages I    <br />mentioned. It's been in use since the 70s, and is a very compact (i.e. not much &quot;vocabulary&quot; to    <br />learn), powerful and well-understood language.    <br />· C++    <br />This language is a superset of C (that just means that it's C with more stuff added; it's more    <br />than C, and includes pretty much all of C). Its main benefit over C is that it's object oriented.</p>
<p>The key point is that object oriented languages are more modern, and using object oriented   <br />languages is the way things are done now in the programming world. So C++ is most definitely    <br />the second-most used language after C, and may soon become the most used language.    <br />· Java    <br />Java has a benefit which other programming languages lack: it's cross-platform. It means    <br />that it runs on more than one platform without needing to be recompiled. A platform is just a    <br />particular type of computer system, like Windows or Mac OS or Linux. Normally, if you wanted    <br />to use the same program on a different platform from the one it was written on, you'd have to    <br />recompile it you'd have to compile a different version for each different platform. Sometimes,    <br />you'd also need to change some of your code to suit the new platform. This probably isn't    <br />surprising, since the different platforms work differently, and look different.    <br />Java has another advantage that it runs inside web browsers, letting programmers create    <br />little applications which can run on web sites. However, Java also has a disadvantage, which is    <br />almost as serious: it's slow. Java achieves its cross-platform trick by putting what is essentially a    <br />big program on your computer which pretends to be a little computer all of its own. The Java    <br />runs inside this &quot;virtual machine&quot;, which runs on whatever platform you're using (like Windows    <br />or Mac OS). Because of this extra layer between the program and the computer's processor chip,    <br />Java is slower than a program written and compiled natively for the same platform. Anyway, as    <br />the Internet develops, Java will be used more widely.</p>
