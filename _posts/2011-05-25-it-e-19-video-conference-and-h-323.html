<p>Internet is nowadays widely used in the world, it provides numerous services, such as   <br />on-line booking, BtoB (business to business) services, databases accesses to the companies. But    <br />all these services are asynchronous, which means that there is a delay between an action from the    <br />user and the response from the service (it's a client/server architecture; a computer provides a    <br />service which is used by one or several clients). The new generation of network communication    <br />tools tries to reach the real time level, which means that there is no delay between the action of    <br />the user and the response.    <br />Real time chats, or for instance video on demand, are the new services provided by the    <br />Internet today. These applications appeared recently and are still in development. One really    <br />interesting applications for these technologies is video conference.    <br />Video conference is a technology which allows people to communicate through computer    <br />networks using an audio stream and a video stream. In a few words, people using video    <br />conference can hear and see their correspondents.    <br />Video conference has been very popular only over ISDN (dedicated digital phone lines).    <br />These days, packet-switched networks, such as IP networks, have opened the door to newer    <br />protocols including H.323. The computing power of the desktop systems, the kind of computers    <br />that can be found in the companies or at home, allows the use of video conference applications.    <br />Moreover, webcams, these little low resolution cameras that can be plugged on a regular    <br />computer, are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and almost every computer has now audio    <br />capabilities.    <br />H.323 is the standard for video conference. It can be used over IP (Internet Protocol), and    <br />possibly over all kinds of switched-packet networks (LAN/Local Area Network, MAN/    <br />Metropolitan Area Network, and WAN/Wide Area Network, including the Internet). It was    <br />defined by the ITU (it is the leading publisher of telecommunication technology, regulatory and    <br />standards information ) in 1996. It is updated almost every year, to fit the new progresses in    <br />network capabilities and computing power. The latest version is H.323.5. It was defined in 2003.    <br />The scope of H.323 covers real-time voice, video and data communication over packet-switched    <br />networks. It has multipoint capabilities (several people can communicate with several other people at    <br />the same time) voice and video conferencing capabilities.    <br />The H.323 protocol can be defined as an &quot;umbrella&quot; specification, which means that the protocol    <br />includes several other protocols. In the H.323, the H.225.0, the H.245, the H.450.x, the T.120    <br />protocols are also defined. In addition to these protocols H.323 uses audio codecs (H.261 and H.263),    <br />video codecs (G.711, G.722, G.723.1, G.728 and G.729), and a real-time transport layer called    <br />RTP/RTCP (Real-time Protocol and Real-time Control Protocol). All these protocols cover a different    <br />aspect of the video conference system.    <br />Video conference is one of the most exciting communication media, and will certainly take</p>
<p>a bigger and bigger place in our future. H.323 is a mature protocol that can be safely used for this   <br />purpose. It is widely used by telecom companies, and offers interesting alternatives to the regular    <br />telephone. With the growing power of Internet and the need of world wide communications,    <br />there is no doubt that video conference will be tomorrow for our society what telephone is    <br />nowadays.</p>
