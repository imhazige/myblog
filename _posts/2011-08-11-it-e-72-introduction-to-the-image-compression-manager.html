<p>The Image Compression Manager provides your application with an interface for compressing   <br />and decompressing images and sequences of images that is independent of devices and algorithms.    <br />Uncompressed image data requires a large amount of storage space. Storing a single    <br />640-by-480 pixel image in 32-bit color can require as much as 1.2 MB. Sequences of images, like    <br />those that might be contained in a QuickTime movie, demand <font color="#0000ff">substantially </font>more storage than    <br />single images. This is true even for sequences that consist of fairly small images, because the    <br />movie consists of such a large number of those images. Consequently, minimizing the storage    <br />requirements for image data is an important consideration for any application that works with    <br />images or sequences of images.    <br />The Image Compression Manager allows your application to    <br /> use a common interface for all image-compression and image-decompression operations;    <br /> take advantage of any compression software or hardware that may be present in a given    <br />Macintosh configuration;    <br /> store compressed image data in pictures;    <br /> temporarily compress sequences of images, further reducing the storage requirements of    <br />movies;    <br /> display compressed PICT files without the need to modify your application;    <br /> use an interface that is appropriate for your applicationa high-level interface if you do    <br />not need to manipulate many compression parameters or a low-level interface that    <br />provides you greater control over the compression operation.    <br />The Image Compression Manager compresses images by invoking image compressor components    <br />and decompresses images using image decompressor components. Compressor and decompressor    <br />components are code resources that present a standard interface to the Image Compression Manager and    <br />provide image-compression and image-decompression services, respectively. The Image Compression    <br />Manager receives application requests and coordinates the actions of the appropriate components. The    <br />components perform the actual compression and decompression. Compressor and decompressor    <br />components are standard components and are managed by the Component Manager. For detailed    <br />information about creating compressor and decompressor components, see Inside Macintosh:    <br />QuickTime Components.    <br />Because the Image Compression Manager is independent of specific compression algorithms    <br />and drivers, it provides a number of advantages to developers of image- compression algorithms.    <br />Specifically, compressor and decompressor components can    <br /> present a common application interface for software-based compressors and hardware-based    <br />compressors;</p>
<p> provide several different compressors and compression options, allowing the Image   <br />Compression Manager or the application to choose the appropriate tool for a particular    <br />situation.</p>
