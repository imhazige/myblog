<p>The broad objective of this project is to maintain and enhance the National <font color="#0000ff">Geochemical</font>     <br />Database (NGDB). The NGDB consists of 1) the original RASS and PLUTO data from the     <br />USGS labs, which are now stored in a common format under the ORACLE relational database     <br />management system; 2) the NURE data, which have been reformatted and reside currently on the     <br />following web site: <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr-97-0492/">http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr-97-0492/</a> where downloads may be made on     <br />the basis of 1:250,000-scale quadrangles; and 3) the newly generated data (approximately 1996þ     <br />present) which reside on the Laboratory Information Management System. The enhancements to     <br />the NGDB will enable both USGS scientists and external customers to more easily extract     <br />immediately useable data on a national, regional, and local scale to help establish a baseline for     <br />the abundance and <font color="#0000ff">spatial</font> distribution of chemical elements in the Earth's surficial materials.     <br />Specific short-term objective include:     <br />Linking the newly developed ORACLE-based database to the Laboratory Information</p>
<p>Management System (LIMS) to provide for the smooth transfer of newly generated data from the    <br />LIMS to the NGDB.     <br />Implement the new Sample Submittal Information procedure on a nationwide basis     <br />throughout the USGS. This procedure has only been implemented at this time (June 2002) in the     <br />Central Region. Without this new system in place, it is possible that more errors and <font color="#0000ff">omissions</font>     <br />regarding the nature and location of samples may be generated.     <br />Complete the re-formatting of the NURE HSSR database based on 1:250,000-scale     <br /><font color="#0000ff">quadrangles</font>, compile the quadrangle-based data into one large data set, and provide these data to     <br />the public via a web site and CD/DVD.     <br />Complete the upgrading of archival USGS geochemical data for Alaska and release these to     <br />the public via a web site and CD/DVD.     <br />Initiate the upgrading of the remainder (non-Alaska) <font color="#0000ff">portion</font> of the USGS-generated data.     <br />Generate subsets of the master databases containing data in a format more useful to geochemists so     <br />they do not have to <font color="#0000ff">wade</font> through the process of extracting the data they need from the entire database.     <br />Communicate and coordinate the work within this Project with other data delivery efforts     <br />within the Bureau such as NatWeb, GEODE, and Spatial Data Delivery.     <br />Produce map representations of the database showing the spatial variation of chemical     <br /><font color="#0000ff">species</font> throughout the nation and within sub-regions that are of priority to the USGS.     <br /><font color="#0000ff">Relevance</font> and Impact     <br />An accurate, easily accessible geochemical database containing multi-element information     <br />on the surficial materials of the nation is vital if the USGS is to respond quickly to earth science     <br />issues raised by Congress and land management and environmental protection agencies. A     <br />nationally consistent geochemical database provides baseline information on the natural     <br />abundance and spatial variation of chemical elements to which changes caused by agricultural     <br />and <font color="#0000ff">irrigation</font> practices, waste disposal, <font color="#0000ff">urbanization</font>, industrial pollution, mineral exploration     <br />and mining activities, environmental induced and restoration activities, and other land-use     <br />practices can be compared. Human-<font color="#0000ff">induced</font> chemical changes to the environment are     <br />superimposed on a variable natural geochemical background where trace-element abundances     <br />can range over several orders of magnitude within short distances. These variations are     <br />inadequately documented and their existence is often overlooked in the setting of public policy.     <br />Important aspects of change cannot be measured, or their consequences anticipated, unless the     <br />present composition of the earth's surface materials is known. In her 2000 Presidential address to     <br />the Geological Society of America, Mary Lou Zoback identified six &quot;grand challenges in earth     <br />and environmental science&quot;. The first of these was &quot;recognizing the signal within the natural     <br />variability&quot;. Zoback stated that &quot;documenting and understanding natural variability is a <font color="#0000ff">vexing</font>     <br />topic in almost every environmental problem. How do we recognize and understand changes in     <br />natural systems if we don't understand the range of baseline values?&quot; Preserving and enhancing     <br />the vast amount of geochemical data within MRP's databases will provide a powerful tool for     <br />addressing this &quot;grand challenge&quot;. The ultimate goal of producing and electronically</p>
<p>disseminating the vast amount of geochemical data within MRP's databases directly supports    <br />many of the goals and objectives as stated in the Science Strategy of the Geologic Division     <br />(Bohlen and others, 1999). These databases are essential for understanding the relationship     <br />between <font color="#0000ff">geologic </font>processes and human health, <font color="#0000ff">ecosystem</font> structure and function, and the     <br />distribution of energy and mineral resources. This project also serves as the focal point of     <br />requests for geochemical data from outside customers. From June 2001 through May 2002, the     <br /><font color="#0000ff">predecessor</font> project (National Geochemical Database Project) received over 100 requests for data     <br />from Federal, state, and local government clients; private sector clients; and internal USGS     <br />clients. At a conservatively estimated cost of $300 per sample for collection, preparation, and     <br />chemical analysis, the geochemical databases under MRP management represent an <font color="#0000ff">expenditure </font>    <br />of over $500 million of taxpayer money. To realize the fullest possible return for this investment,     <br />these data must be archived in <font color="#0000ff">perpetuity </font>in an easily accessible and user-friendly format for full     <br />utilization by the wide array of customers that need geochemical data to accomplish their work.</p>
