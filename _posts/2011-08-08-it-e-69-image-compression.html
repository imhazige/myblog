<p>Why is image compression so important? Image files, in an uncompressed form, are very large.   <br />And the Internet, especially for people using a 56k dialup modem, can be pretty slow.[1]This    <br />combination could seriously limit one of the Web's most appreciated aspectsits ability to present    <br />images easily.    <br />JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)compression is currently the best way to compress    <br />PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES for the web. Other forms of image compression, including GIF and    <br />PNG, are best used for other purposes on the web.    <br />GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is best used for graphics that have a limited color pallet    <br />and large areas of flat tone, like cartoons or banners. Although it has several remarkable features,    <br />such as transparency and the ability to present animated images, it is not well suited for the    <br />presentation of <font color="#0000ff">continuous tone</font> images, such as photographs, due to its limit of 256 colors.    <br />PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a relatively new format with a lot of potential but, until    <br />all browsers can see images compressed in PNG form, it is not a good idea to use it.    <br />JPEG, or JPG, is an evolving format that is universal in its use as a means of compressing    <br />continuous tone photographs for speedy transmission over the Internet. Photographs compressed    <br />using the JPEG format look good because JPEG supports millions of colors, so you can see the    <br /><font color="#0000ff">gradation </font>of tones.    <br />A Bitmap is a simple series of pixels all stacked up. But the same image saved in GIF or    <br />JPEG format uses less bytes to make up the file. How? Compression.    <br />&quot;Compression&quot; is a computer term that represents a variety of mathematical formats used to    <br />compress an image's byte size. Let's say you have an image where the upper right-hand corner    <br />has four pixels all the same color. Why not find a way to make those four pixels into one?[2]That    <br />would cut down the number of bytes by three-fourths, at least in the one corner. That's a    <br />compression factor.    <br />Bitmaps can be compressed to a point. The process is called &quot;run-length encoding.&quot; Runs of    <br />pixels that are all the same color are all combined into one pixel. [3]The longer the run of pixels,</p>
<p>the more compression. Bitmaps with little detail or color variance will really compress. Those   <br />with a great deal of detail don't offer much in the way of compression. Bitmaps that use the    <br />run-length encoding can carry either the common &quot;.bmp&quot; extension or &quot;.rle&quot;. Another difference    <br />between the two files is that the common Bitmap can accept 16 million different colors per pixel.    <br />Saving the same image in run-length encoding knocks the bits-per-pixel down to 8. That locks    <br />the level of color in at no more than 256.    <br />So, why not create a single pixel when all of the colors are close? You could even lower the    <br />number of colors available so that you would have a better chance of the pixels being close in    <br />color. Good idea. The people at CompuServe felt the same way.    <br />GIF, which stands for &quot;Graphic Interchange Format,&quot; was first standardized in 1987 by    <br />CompuServe, although the patent for the algorithm (mathematical formula) used to create GIF    <br />compression actually belongs to Unisys. The first format of GIF used on the Web was called    <br />GIF87a, representing its year and version. It saved images at 8 bits-per-pixel, capping the color    <br />level at 256. That 8-bit level allowed the image to work across multiple server styles, including    <br />CompuServe, TCP/IP.    <br />CompuServe updated the GIF format in 1989 to include animation, transparency, and interlacing.    <br />They called the new format, you guessed it: GIF89a.    <br />There's no <font color="#0000ff">discernable</font> difference between a basic (known as non-<font color="#0000ff">interlaced</font>) GIF in 87 and    <br />89 formats.</p>
