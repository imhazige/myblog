<p>There are several factors that affect data transmission. They include speed or bandwidth,   <br />serial or parallel transmission, direction of data flow, modes of transmission data, and protocols.    <br />Bandwidth </p>
<p>The different communications channels have different data transmission speeds.   <br />This bit-per-second transmission capability of a channel is called its bandwidth. Bandwidth may be    <br />of three types: voiceband, medium band, and broadband. Voiceband is the bandwidth of a standard    <br />telephone line and used often for microcomputer transmission, the bps is 300-9600. Medium band    <br />is the bandwidth of special liased lines used mainly with minicomputers and mainframe computers,    <br />the bps is 56,000/264 million. Broadband is the bandwidth that includes microwave, satellite,    <br />coaxial cable, and fiber-optic channels. It is used for very high-speed computers whose processors    <br />communicate directly with each other. It is in the range of 56,000/30 billion bps.    <br />Serial or Parallel Transmission Data travels in two ways: serially and in parallel. In serial    <br />data transmission, bits flow in a serial or continuous stream, like cars crossing a one-lane bridge. Each    <br />bit travels on its own communications line. [1]Serial transmission is the way most data is sent over    <br />telephones lines. Thus, the plug-in board making up the serial connector in a microcomputer's modem    <br />is usually called a serial port. More technical names for the serial port are RS-232C connector and    <br />asynchronous communications port. With parallel data transmission, bits flow through separate lines    <br />simultaneously. In other words, they resemble cars moving together at the same speed on a multilane    <br />freeway. Parallel transmission is typically limited to communications over short distances and is not    <br />used over telephone lines. It is, however, a standard methods of sending data from a computer's CPU    <br />to a printer.    <br />Direction of Data Transmission </p>
<p>There are three directions or modes of data flow in a data   <br />communications system: simplexcommunication, half-duplex communication, and full-duplex    <br />communication. Simplex communication resembles the movement of cars on a one-way street.    <br />Data travels in one direction only. It is not frequently used in data communication systems today.    <br />One instance in which it is used may be in point-of sale (POS) terminals in which data is being    <br />entered only. In half-duplex communication, data flows in both directions, but not simultaneously.    <br />That is, data flows in only one direction at any one time. This resembles traffic on a one-lane</p>
<p>bridge. Half-duplex is very common and is frequently used for linking microcomputers by   <br />telephone lines to other microcomputers, minicomputers, and mainframes. Thus, when you dial    <br />into an electronic bulletin&#160; board through your microcomputer, you may well be using half-duplex    <br />communication. In full-duplex communication, data is transmitted back and forth at the same    <br />time, like traffic on a two-way street. It is clearly the fastest and most efficient form of two-way    <br />communication. However, it requires special equipment and is used primarily for mainframe    <br />communications. An example is the weekly sales figures that a supermarket or regional office    <br />sends to its corporate headquarters in another place.    <br />Modes of Transmitting Data </p>
<p>Data may be sent by asynchronous or synchronous transmission.   <br />In asynchronous transmission, the method frequently used with microcomputers, data is sent and    <br />received one byte a time. Asynchronous transmission is often used for terminals with slow speeds. Its    <br />advantage is that the data can be transmitted whenever convenient for the sender. Its disadvantage is a    <br />relatively slow rate of data transfer. Synchronous transmission is used to transfer great quantities of    <br />information by sending several bytes or a block at a time. For the data transmission to occur, the    <br />sending and receiving of the blocks of bytes must occur at carefully timed intervals. Thus, the system    <br />requires a synchronized clock. Its advantage is that data can be sent very quickly. Its disadvantage is    <br />the cost of the required equipment.    <br />Protocols </p>
<p>For data transmission to be successful, sender and receiver must follows a set of   <br />communication rules for the exchange of information. These rules for exchanging data between    <br />computers are known as the line protocol. A communication software package like Crosstalk    <br />helps define the protocol, such as speeds and modes, for connecting with another microcomputer.    <br />TCP/IP ( Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) are the two standard protocols for    <br />communications on the Internet.    <br />TCP/IP is the &quot;language&quot; of the Internet. It is a networking technology developed by the    <br />United States Government Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) in the 1970s.    <br />It is most commonly employed to provide access to the Internet but can be and is used by many    <br />people to create a LAN that may or may not connect to the Internet. In many aspects TCP/IP is a    <br />client/server-type LAN, but many manufacturers of TCP/IP software have applications that allow    <br />the &quot;clients&quot; to serve files or even applications. TCP/IP is truly an open systems protocol. This    <br />means that no one manufacturer creates the product—any computer running TCP/IP software can    <br />connect to anyone else who has TCP/IP software (provided the user has an account and security    <br />permissions), regardless of who made the particular version of software.    <br />When different types of microcomputers are connected in a network, the protocols can    <br />become very complex. Obviously, for the connections to work, these network protocols must    <br />adhere to certain standards. The first commercially available set of standards was IBM's Systems    <br />Network Architecture (SNA). This works for IBM's own equipment, but other machines won't    <br />necessarily communicate with them. The International Standards Organization has defined a set of    <br />communications protocols called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI). The purpose of the OSI    <br />model is to identify functions provided by any network. [2]It separates each network's functions into</p>
<p>seven &quot;layers&quot; of protocols, or communication rules. When two network systems communicate,   <br />their corresponding layers may exchange data. [3]This assumes that the microcomputers and other    <br />equipment on each network have implemented the same functions and interfaces.</p>
