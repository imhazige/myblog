<p>Why change vectors to bitmaps?   <br />Most of the clip art gallery is vector-based and will need to be converted into bitmap formats    <br />(GIF) prior to putting it on the Web.    <br />Why change bitmaps to vectors?    <br />You will need to change vectors to bitmaps to perform tasks from the Drawing toolbar on a    <br />bitmap picture (such as animate parts of a bitmap picture) you will need to convert it into a vector    <br />format. You can then e.g. ungroup it and apply animations to only parts of it.    <br />Which graphic converter to use?    <br />To change your graphics format, you need to use a graphics converter. A popular graphics    <br />editor you can use for this is Paint Shop Pro. Another graphics editor you can use is Adobe    <br />PhotoShop, which is said to be the best one for this kind of conversion.    <br />How to use your graphic converter?    <br />Open your file in the graphics editor chosen: Select File | Open.    <br />Select File | Save As.    <br />Rename your file and choose a new format. For a bitmap to vectors conversion select the    <br />WMF format. For the opposite conversion, select the GIF format if you have PowerPoint 97,    <br />otherwise select JPEG or TIFF.    <br />Unfortunately, some of the quality may be lost in the switch. MS office also provides    <br />graphics converters.</p>
