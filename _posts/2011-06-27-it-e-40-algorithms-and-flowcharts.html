<p>The computer scientist Niklaus Wirth stated that:   <br />Programs = Algorithms + Data    <br />The algorithm is part of the blueprint or plan for the computer program; an algorithm is:    <br />&quot;An effective procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps.&quot;    <br />It is effective, which means that an answer is found and it finishes, that is it has a finite    <br />number of steps. A well-designed algorithm will always provide an answer, and it may not be the    <br />answer you want but there will be an answer. It may be that the answer is that there is no answer.    <br />A well-designed algorithm is also guaranteed to terminate.    <br />The key features of an algorithm are:    <br />Sequence (also known as Process),    <br />Decision (also known as Selection)    <br />Repetition (also known as Iteration or Looping)    <br />In 1964 the mathematicians Corrado Bohm and Guiseppe Jacopini demonstrated that any    <br />algorithm can be stated using sequence, decision and repetition. The work of Bohm and Jacopini    <br />was of great importance since it eventually led to the disciplines of structured program design    <br />that are much used today.    <br />Sequence means that each step or process in the algorithm is executed in the specified order.    <br />In an algorithm each process must be in the correct place, otherwise the algorithm will most    <br />probably fail.    <br />The Decision constructsIf ... then, If ... then ... else ...    <br />In algorithms the outcome of a decision is either true or false, and there is no in between.    <br />The outcome of the decision is based on some condition that can only result in a true or false    <br />value[1].    <br />The decision takes the form: if proposition then process    <br />A proposition in this sense is a statement, which can only be true or false. It is either true    <br />that today is Wednesday or false that today is Wednesday. It can't be both true and false. If the    <br />proposition is true then the process, which follows the then, is executed.    <br />The decision can also be stated as:    <br />if proposition    <br />then process1    <br />else process2    <br />This is the if ... then ... else ... form of the decision. This means that if the proposition is true</p>
<p>then execute process1 else or otherwise execute process2.   <br />The first form of the decision if proposition then process has a null else, that is, there is no    <br />else.    <br />The Repetition constructsRepeat and While    <br />Repetition takes two forms, the Repeat loop and the While loop.    <br />The repeat loop is used to iterate or repeat a process or sequence of processes until some    <br />condition becomes true. It has the general form:    <br />Repeat    <br />Process1    <br />Process2    <br />ProcessN    <br />Until proposition    <br />The repeat loop does some processing before testing the state of the proposition.    <br />The while loop is used to iterate or repeat a process or sequence of processes while some    <br />condition becomes true. It has the general form:    <br />While proposition    <br />Process1    <br />Process2    <br />ProcessN    <br />The while loop tests the state of the proposition first.    <br />There are four different ways of stating algorithms: Step-Form, Pseudocode, Flowchart, and    <br />Nassi-Schneiderman.    <br />The first two are written forms. The written form is just normal language.[2]A problem with    <br />human language is that it can seem to be <font color="#0000ff">imprecise</font>. In terms of meaning, what I write may not be    <br />the same as what you read.[3]Pseudocode is also human language but tends toward more precision    <br />by using a limited vocabulary.    <br />The last two are graphically-oriented, that is they use symbols and language to represent    <br />sequence, decision and repetition.    <br />Flow charts are a graphical method of designing programs and once    <br />the rules are learned they are very easy to draw. A well-drawn flow chart    <br />is also very easy to read.    <br />The major symbols are the DECISION (also known as selection)    <br />and the SEQUENCE (or process) symbols. The START and STOP symbols are called the    <br />terminals. The SUBPROCESS symbol is a variation on the sequence symbol.</p>
