<p>Backdoor programs are typically more dangerous than computer viruses, as they can be   <br />used by an intruder to take control of a PC and <font color="#0000ff">potentially</font> gain access to an entire network.    <br />Backdoor programs, also referred to as Trojan horses, are typically sent as attachments to    <br />e-mails with innocent-looking file names, tricking users into installing them. They often enable    <br />remote users to listen in on conversations using the host computer's microphone, or even see    <br />through its video camera if it has one. Back Orifice (BO) 2000 is a backdoor program designed    <br />for malicious use. Its main purpose is to maintain unauthorized control over another machine for    <br />reconfiguration and data collection. It takes the form of a client/server application that can    <br />remotely control a machine without the user's knowledge to gather information, perform system    <br />commands, reconfigure machines and redirect network traffic.    <br />With BO an intruder has to know the user's IP address to connect, or could scan an entire    <br />network looking for the victim. Once connected, the intruder can send requests to the BO 2000    <br />server program, which performs the actions the intruder specifies on the victim's computer,    <br />sending back the results.    <br />BO is installed on the server machine simply through the execution of the server application.    <br />This executable file is originally named bo2k.exe, but it can be renamed. The configuration wizard    <br />will step through the various configuration settings, including the server file (the executable), the    <br />network protocol, port number, encryption, and password. Once this process is complete, running    <br />bo2kgui.exe executes the user interface for BO.    <br />It is very difficult to detect BO, because it is so highly configurable. In addition, backdoor    <br />programs are multi-dimensional, so several detection methods are recommended to achieve maximum    <br />protection and awareness of the installation of BO 2000 on a machine or series of machines on a    <br />network.    <br />We recommend coupling the use of an updated version of anti-virus software to detect    <br />which machines on the network have BO installedand intrusion detection software to identify    <br />attacks over the network.    <br />Users are urged to follow three important precautions:    <br />Do not accept files from Internet chat systems.    <br />If you are connected to the Internet, do not enable network sharing without proper security    <br />in place.    <br />Do not open e-mail attachments: never run any executable files sent to you (.exe files or .zip    <br />files with a.exe in them). It is safer if these are run through a virus checker first, but they could be</p>
<p>new backdoor programs or viruses that a virus scanner will not detect. It is safe to open Word   <br />documents and Excel spreadsheets if the Microsoft Auto-Run feature is turned off. Allowing    <br />macros to run automatically can spread e-mail viruses such as Melissa. Many people send each    <br />other animations in e-mail: it is easy to put a backdoor program into one of these and users    <br />cannot tell when they infect their computers with Back Orifice 2000.</p>
