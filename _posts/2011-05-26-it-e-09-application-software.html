<p>﻿Application software might be described as end-user software. Application software performs&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />useful work on general-purpose tasks such as word processing and cost estimating. There are&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />certain general-purpose programs that are widely used in nearly all career areas. They are: word&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />processing, electronic spreadsheets, graphic programs and so on. They are also called basic tools&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />and have some common features.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Insert Point </p>
<p>The insert point or cursor shows you where you can enter data next. Typically ,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />it is a blinking vertical bar on the screen. You can move it around using a mouse or the directional&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />arrow keys on many keyboards.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Menus </p>
<p>Almost all software packages have menus. Typically, the menus are displayed in a&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />menu bar at the top of the screen. When one of these is selected, a pull-down menu appears. This&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />is a list of commands associated with the selected menu.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Help </p>
<p>For most applications, one of the menus on the menu bar is Help. When selected, the&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Help options appear. [1]These options typically include a table of contents, a search feature to&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />locate reference information about specific commands, and central options to move around.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Button Bars </p>
<p>Button bars typically are below the menu bar. They contain icons or graphic&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />representations for commonly used commands. This offers the user a graphic approach to&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />selecting commands. It is an example of a graphic user interface in which graphic objects rather&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />than menus can be used to select commands.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Dialog Box Dialog boxes frequently appear after selecting a command from a pull-down&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />menu. These boxes are used to specify additional command options.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Scroll Bars Scroll bars are usually located on the right and/or the bottom of the screen.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />They enable you to display additional information not currently visible on the screen.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />WYSIWYG Pronounced &quot;wizzy-wig&quot;, WYSIWYG stands for &quot;What You See Is What You&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Get.&quot; This means that the image on the screen display looks the same as the final printed document.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Application programs without WYSIWYG cannot always display an exact representation of the&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />final printed document. The WYSIWYG feature allows the user to preview the document's&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />appearance before it is printed out.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Function Keys </p>
<p>Function keys are labeled F1, F2, and so on. These keys are positioned&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />along the left side or along the top of the keyboard. They are used for commands or tasks that are&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />performed frequently, such as underlining. These keys do different things in different software&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />packages.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Now let's introduce respectively the most common used application software: word processing,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />and spreadsheets.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />Word processing software is used to create, edit, save, and print documents. Documents can&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />be any kind of text material. With word processing, you view the words you type on a monitor&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />instead of on a piece of paper. After you finish your typing, save your words on diskettes or hard&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />disk, and print the results on paper.    <br />The beauty of this method is that you can make changes or corrections before printing out    <br />the document. Even after your document is printed out, you can easily go back and make changes.    <br />You can then print it out again. Want to change a report from double spaced to single spaced?    <br />Alter the width of the margins on the left and right? Delete some paragraphs and add some others    <br />from yet another document? A word processor allows you to do all these with ease. Indeed,    <br />deleting, inserting, and replacing—the principal correcting activities—can be done just by    <br />pressing keys on the keyboard. Popular word processing software are Word , WPS and so on.    <br />They have some common features.    <br />Word Wrap and the Enter Key One basic word processing feature is word wrap. When    <br />you finish a line, a word processor decides for you and automatically moves the insertion point to    <br />the next lines. To begin a new paragraph or leave a blank line, you press the Enter key.    <br />Search and Replace A search or find command allows you to locate any character, word,    <br />or phrase in your document. When you search, the insertion point moves to the first place the    <br />item appears. If you want, the program will continue to search for all other locations where the    <br />item appears. The replace command automatically replaces the word you search for with another    <br />word. The search and replace commands are useful for finding and fixing errors.    <br />Cut, Copy, and Paste With a word processor, you select the portion of text to be moved by    <br />highlighting it. Using either the menu or button bar, choose the command to cut the selected text.    <br />The selected text disappears from your screen. Then move the insertion point to the new location    <br />and choose the paste command to reinsert the text into the document. In a similar manner, you    <br />can copy selected portions of text from one location to another.    <br />Spreadsheet </p>
<p>A spreadsheet is an electronic worksheet used to organize and manipulate   <br />numbers and display options for analysis. Spreadsheets are used by financial analysts, accountants,    <br />contractors, and others concerned with manipulating numeric data. Spreadsheets allow you to try    <br />out various &quot;what-if&quot; kinds of possibilities. That is a powerful feature. You can manipulate numbers    <br />by using stored formulas and calculate different outcomes.    <br />A spreadsheet has several parts. The worksheet area of the spreadsheet has letters for    <br />column headings across the top. It also has numbers for row headings down the left side. The    <br />intersection of a column and row is called a cell. The cell holds a single unit of information. The    <br />position of a cell is called the cell address. For example, &quot;A1&quot; is the cell address of the first    <br />position on a spreadsheet, the topmost and leftmost position. A cell pointer—also known as the    <br />cell selector—indicates where data is to be entered or changed in the spreadsheet. The cell    <br />pointer can be moved around in much the same way that you move the insertion pointer in a    <br />word processing program. Excel is the most common spreadsheet software. It has some common    <br />features of spreadsheet programs.    <br />Format Label is often used to identify information in a worksheet, it is usually a word or    <br />symbol. A number in cell is called a value. Labels and values can be displayed or formatted in    <br />different ways. A label can be centered in the cell or positioned to the left or right. A value can be</p>
<p>displayed to show decimal places, dollars, or percent. The number of decimal positions can be   <br />altered, and the width of columns can be changed.    <br />Formulas One of the benefits of spreadsheets is that you can manipulate data through the    <br />use of formulas. Formulas are instructions for calculations. They make connections between    <br />numbers in particular cells.    <br />Functions </p>
<p>Functions are built-in formulas that perform calculations automatically.   <br />Recalculation </p>
<p>Recalculation or what-if analysis is one of the most important features of   <br />spreadsheets. If you change one or more numbers in your spreadsheet, all related formulas will    <br />recalculate automatically. Thus you can substitute one value for another in the cells affected by    <br />your formula and recalculate the results. For more complex problems, recalculation enables you    <br />to store long, complicated formulas and many changing values and quickly produce alternatives.</p>
