<p>The Web can be an incredible resource providing information on nearly any topic   <br />imaginable. Are you planning a trip? Writing an Economics paper? Looking for a movie review?    <br />Trying to locate a long-lost friend? Information sources related to these questions, and much,    <br />much more are available on the Web.    <br />With over two billion pages and more being added daily, the Web is a massive collection of    <br />interrelated pages. With so much available information, locating the precise information you    <br />need can be difficult. Fortunately, a number of organizations called search services or search    <br />providers can help you locate the information you need. They maintain huge databases relating to    <br />information provided on the Web and the Internet. The information stored at these databases    <br />includes addresses, content descriptions or classifications, and keywords appearing on Web pages    <br />and other Internet informational resources. Special programs called agents, spiders, or bots</p>
<p>continually look for new information and update the search services databases. Additionally,   <br />search services provide special programs called search engines that you can use to locate specific    <br />information of the Web.    <br />[1]Search engines are specialized programs that assist you in locating information on the Web    <br />and the Internet. To find information, you go to the search service's Web site and use their search    <br />engine. Yahoo’s search engine, like most others, provides two different search approaches.    <br />Keyword Search    <br />In a keyword search, you enter a keyword or phrase reflecting the information you want.    <br />The search engine compares your entry against its database and returns a list of hits or sites that    <br />contain the keywords. Each hit includes a hyperlink to the referenced Web page (or other    <br />resource) along with a brief discussion of the information contained at that location. Many    <br />searches result in a large number of hits. For example, if you were to enter the keyword travel,    <br />you would get over a thousand hits. [2]Search engines order the hits according to those sites that    <br />most likely contain the information requested and present the list to you in that order, usually in    <br />groups of ten.    <br />Directory Search    <br />Most search engines also provide a directory or list of categories or topics such as Arts    <br />&amp;Humanities, Business &amp; Economics, Computers &amp; Internet. In a directory search, also known    <br />as index search. You select a category that fits the information that you want. Another list of    <br />subtopics relates to the topic you selected appears. You select the subtopic that best relates to    <br />your topic and another subtopic list appears. You continue to narrow your search in this manner    <br />until a list of Web sites appears. This list corresponds to the hit list previously discussed.    <br />As a general rule, if you are searching for general information, use the directory search    <br />approach. For example, to find general information about music, use a directory search beginning    <br />with the category Arts &amp;Humanities. If you are searching for specific information, use the key    <br />word approach. For example, if you were looking for a specific MP3 file, use a key word search    <br />entering the album title and/or the artist’s name in the text selection box.    <br />A recent study by the NEC Research Institute found that any one search engine includes    <br />only a fraction of the informational sources on the Web. Therefore, it is highly recommended that    <br />you use more than one search engine when researching important topics. Or, you could use a    <br />special type of search engine called a metasearch engine.&quot;    <br />One way to research a topic is to visit the Web site for several individual search engines. At    <br />each site, enter the search instructions, wait for the hits to appear, review the list, and visit    <br />selected sites. This process can be quite time-consuming and duplicate responses from different    <br />search engines are inevitable. Metasearch engines offer an alternative.    <br />Metasearch engines are programs that automatically submit your search request to several</p>
<p>search engines simultaneously. The metasearch engine receives the results, eliminates duplicates,   <br />orders the hits, and then provides the edited list to you. There are several metasearch sites    <br />available on the Web. One of the best known is Metacrawler.</p>
<p>Specialized search engines focus on subject-specific Web sites. Specialized sites can   <br />potentially save you time by narrowing your search. For example, let's say you are researching a    <br />paper about the fashion industry. You could begin with a general search engine like Yahoo! Or,    <br />you could go to a search engine that specialized specifically in fashion.</p>
