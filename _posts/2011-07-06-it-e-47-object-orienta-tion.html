<p>OO can model a complex reality in a very natural way.   <br />An example is &quot;the cup of coffee&quot;. This shows interaction between customer, waiter and    <br />kitchen.    <br /> Customer and kitchen don't know each other. The waiter is the <font color="#0000ff">intermediary</font>. (Encapsulation).    <br /> Waiter and kitchen act differently to the request &quot;a black coffee&quot; (Polymorphism)    <br /> Both waiter and kitchen supply coffee (Inheritance).    <br />The benefits of OO are higher for complex business processes. The more complex the better.    <br />Different responsibilities, lots of exceptions, and processes that &quot;look alike&quot;. Those are the ideal    <br />ingredients for an OO approach.</p>
<p>Encapsulation means as much as shielding. Each   <br />OO object has a shield around it. Objects can't &quot;see&quot; each    <br />other. They can exchange things though, as if they are    <br />interconnected through a <font color="#0000ff">hatch</font>.    <br />Customer, waiter and kitchen are three shielded objects    <br />in the &quot;cup of coffee&quot; example. Customer and kitchen do not    <br />know each other. The waiter is the intermediary between    <br />those two. Objects can't see each other in an Object-oriented    <br />world. The 'hatch' enables them to communicate and exchange coffee and money.    <br />Encapsulation keeps computer systems flexible. The business process can change easily.    <br />The customer does not care about the coffee brew process. Even the waiter does not care. This    <br />allows the kitchen to be reconstructed, is only the &quot;hatch&quot; remains the same. It is even possible to    <br />change the entire business process. Suppose the waiter will brew coffee himself. The customer    <br />won't notice any difference.    <br />Encapsulation enables OO experts to build flexible systems. Systems that can extend as your    <br />business extends. Every module of the system can change independently, no impact to the other    <br />modules.    <br />Objects can respond differently to the same message. Both waiter as kitchen respond to&quot;a    <br />black coffee&quot;.    <br />The actions are different though.    <br /> The waiter passes the message to the    <br />kitchen, waits for response, delivers    <br />coffee and settles the account.    <br /> The kitchen brews fresh coffee and    <br />passes it to the waiter.    <br />The same message with different    <br />implementations, that is polymorphism.    <br />Polymorphism makes Object-oriented systems extremely suitable for various exceptions and    <br />exceptions to exceptions.    <br />Inheritance    <br />Similar, but just a little bit different. The world is full of exceptions and similarities. Object    <br />Orientation places everything perfectly in a class tree.    <br /> Both waiter and cook are employees. So they both    <br />have an employee number. This generic    <br />employee number gets a generic place in    <br />Employee.    <br /> Both return a cup of coffee to the question &quot;A    <br />cup of coffee please&quot;. That similar behavior</p>
<p>also gets a generic place in Employee.   <br /> There are some exceptions. Waiter and    <br />Cook have different methods to get a    <br />cup of    <br />coffee. Those specific methods get a    <br />specific place, reusing the more generic    <br />part in Employee.    <br />No matter how complex your business    <br />situation is, Object Orientation can cope with    <br />it.</p>
