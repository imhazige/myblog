<p>A VoIP phone is designed specifically for use in a voice over IP(VoIP)system by converting   <br />standard telephone audio into a digital format that can be transmitted over the Internet, and by    <br />converting incoming digital phone signals from the Internet to standard telephone audio. A VoIP    <br />phone allows the user to take advantage of VoIP technology without involving a personal computer,    <br />although an Internet connection is required. Physically, a VoIP phone set resembles a traditional    <br />hard wired or cordless telephone set. Some VoIP phone sets offer enhanced quality audio,    <br />comparable to that on compact disc (CD). A few VoIP phone sets allow for the transmission and    <br />reception of image data during calls, so they can be considered video telephones.    <br />An IP PBX is a private branch exchange (telephone switching system within an enterprise )    <br />that switches calls between VoIP users on local lines while allowing all users to share a certain</p>
<p>number of external phone lines. The typical IP PBX can also switch calls between a VoIP user   <br />and a traditional telephone user, or between two traditional telephone user in the same way that a    <br />conventional PBX does. With a conventional PBX, separate networks are necessary for voice and    <br />data communications. One of the main advantages of an IP PBX is the fact that it employs    <br />converged data and voice networks. This means that Internet access, as well as VoIP    <br />communications and traditional telephone communications, are all possible using a single line to    <br />each user. This provide flexibility as an enterprise grows, and can also reduce long-term    <br />operation and maintenance costs.    <br />Ear and mouth (E&amp;M) is a technology in voice over IP (VoIP) that uses a traditional    <br />telephone handset with an earphone (or earpiece) for listening to incoming audio and a    <br />microphone (or mouthpiece) for transmitting audio. Calls using an E&amp;M interface can be made    <br />from, received from , or disconnected by a private banch exchange (PBX) as well as from a    <br />VoIP-capable computer.    <br />The main advantage of E&amp;M is the fact that it allows a PBX to reliably detect disconnect    <br />(hang-up) signals. This eliminates problems that can otherwise occur with locked computer ports    <br />at the terminations of calls, and thus minimizes the risk of needlessly consuming network    <br />resources.</p>
