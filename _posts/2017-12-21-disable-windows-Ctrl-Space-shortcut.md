As a developer when you have Chinese keyboard language, you may encouter such a problem that the default shortcut Ctrl - Space will conflict your IDE auto completion shortcut.

To disable the system shortcut, you could do the flowing steps:
- Go to control panel.
- Click region and language(区域和语言).
- Select keyboard and language tab.
- Then you will see the Ctrl - Space shortcut. set it to none.
- If you are using any editor, you need restart the editor to see the change take place.


You can use Ctrl + Shift to switch to another keyboard.

In this way, you need not chnange any windows system register table.

If you know Chinese, please see [this post](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/7e440953e9117b2fc0e2ef02.html).
