<p>Graph plotters are used to produce high quality precision graphics usually on large sheets   <br />of paper.    <br />They are slow, but can draw continuous curves often in a variety of colours. They are    <br />especially useful for architectural drawings, building plans and    <br />CAD (Computer Aided Design) applications, where precision    <br />drawing is required.    <br />A mechanical arm holds a pen which can be moved    <br />across the page. The paper is sometimes laid on a flat bed    <br />(flat bed plotter) or on a rotating drum (drum plotter).</p>
