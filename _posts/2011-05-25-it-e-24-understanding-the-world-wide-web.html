<p>it-e-24 Understanding the World Wide Web</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is a system of Internet servers that supports hypertext to access   <br />several Internet protocols on single interface. The World Wide Web is often abbreviated as the    <br />Web or WWW.    <br />The World Wide Web was developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee of the European Particle    <br />Physics Lab (CERN) in Switzerland. The initial purpose of the Web was to use networked    <br />hypertext to facilitate communication among its members, who were located in several counties.    <br />Word was soon spread beyond CERN, and a rapid growth in the number of both developers and    <br />users ensued. In addition to hypertext, the Web began to incorporate graphics, video and sound.    <br />The use of the Web has now reached global proportions.</p>
<p>Almost every protocol type available on the Internet is accessible on the Web. Internet</p>
<p>protocols are sets of rules that allow for intermachine communication on the Internet. The   <br />following major protocols are accessible on the Web:    <br />E-mail (Simple Mail Transport Protocol or SMTP): Distributes electronic messages and files    <br />to one or more electronic mailboxes    <br />Telnet (Telnet Protocol): Facilitates login to a computer host to execute commands    <br />FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Transfers text or binary files between an FTP server and client    <br />Usenet (Network News Transfer Protocol or NNTP): Distributes Usenet news articles    <br />derived from topical discussions on newsgroups    <br />HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Transmits hypertext over networks. This is the    <br />protocol of the WWW.    <br />Many other protocols are available on the Web. To name just one example, the Voice over    <br />Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows users to place a telephone call over the Web.    <br />The World Wide Web provides a single interface for accessing all these protocols. This creates    <br />a convenient and user-friendly environment. It is no longer necessary to be conversant in these    <br />protocols within separate command-level environments. The Web gathers together these protocols    <br />into a single system. Because of this feature and because of the Web's ability to work with    <br />multimedia and advanced programming languages, the World Wide Web is the fastest-growing    <br />component of the Internet.    <br />The operation of the Web relies primarily on hypertext as its means of information retrieval.    <br />HyperText is a document containing words that connect to other documents. These words are called    <br />links and are selectable by the user. A single hypertext document can contain links to many    <br />documents. In the context of the Web, words or graphics may serve as links to other documents,    <br />images, video and sound. Links may or may not follow a logical path, as each connection is    <br />programmed by the creator of the source document. Overall, the WWW contains a complex virtual    <br />Web of connections among a vast number of documents, graphics, videos and sounds.    <br />Producing hypertext for the Web is accomplished by creating documents with a language    <br />called HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. With HTML, tags are placed within the text to    <br />accomplish document formatting, visual features such as font size, italics and bold, and the    <br />creation of hypertext links. Graphics may also be incorporated into an HTML document. HTML    <br />is an evolving language, with new tags being added as each upgrade of the language is developed    <br />and released. The World Wide Web Consortium, led by Tim Berners-Lee, coordinates the efforts    <br />of standardizing HTML.    <br />The World Wide Web consists of files called pages or Web pages, containing information    <br />and links to resources throughout the Internet.    <br />Web pages can be created by user activity. For example, if you visit a Web search engine    <br />and enter keywords on the topic of your choice, a page will be created containing the results of</p>
<p>your search. In fact, an increasing amount of information found on the Web today is served from   <br />databases, creating temporary Web pages &quot;on the fly&quot; in response to user queries. Access to Web    <br />pages may be accomplished by:    <br />Entering an Internet address and retrieving a page directly.    <br />Browsing through pages and selecting links to move from one page to another.    <br />Searching through subject directories linked to organized collections of Web pages.    <br />Entering a search statement at a search engine to retrieve pages on the topic of your    <br />choice.    <br />Today's World Wide Web presents an ever-diversified experience of multimedia, programming    <br />languages and real-time communication. There is no question that it is a challenge to keep up with the    <br />rapid pace of developments. The following presents a brief description of some of the more important    <br />trends to watch.    <br />The Web has become a broadcast medium. It is possible to listen to audio and video over the    <br />Web both pre-recorded and live. For example, you can visit the sites of various news organizations    <br />and view the same videos shown on the nightly television news. Several plug-ins are available for    <br />viewing these videos. For example, Apple's Quick Time Player downloads files with the .mov    <br />extension and displayed these as &quot;movies&quot; in a small window on your computer screen. Quick Time    <br />files can be quite large, and it may take patience to wait for the entire movie to download into your    <br />computer before you can view it.    <br />The problem if slow download times has been answered by a revolutionary development in    <br />multimedia capability: Streaming media. In this case, audio or video files are played as they are    <br />downloading or streaming into your computer. Only a small wait, called buffering, is necessary    <br />before the file begins to play. The RealPlayer plug-in plays streaming audio and video files.    <br />Extensive files such as interviews, speeches and hearings work very well with the RealPlayer.    <br />The RealPlayer is also ideal for the broadcast of real-time events. These may include press    <br />conferences, live radio and television broadcasts, concerts, etc. The Windows Media Player is    <br />another streaming media player. Many sites offer the option to use one player or the other. A list    <br />of sites that make use of these programs is available on the page, Multimedia on the Web.    <br />Shockwave presents another multimedia experience. Shockwave allows for the creation and    <br />implementation of an entire multimedia display combining graphics, animation and sound.    <br />Sound files, including music, may also be heard on the Web. It is not uncommon to visit a    <br />Web page and hear background music. Sound files are also available for downloading    <br />independent of Web page visits. Sound files of many types are supported by the Web with the    <br />appropriate plug-ins. The MP3 file format, and the choice of supporting plug-ins, is the latest    <br />music trend to sweep the Web. The famous Napster site allows for the exchange of MP3 files.    <br />Live cams are anther aspect of the multimedia experience available on the Web. Live cams    <br />are video cameras that send their data in real time to a Web server. These cams may appear in all</p>
<p>kinds of locations, both serious and whimsical: an office, on top of a building, a scenic locale, a   <br />special event, and so on.    <br />The use of existing and new programming languages has extended the capabilities of the    <br />Web. What follows is a basic guide to a group of the more common languages and functions in    <br />use on the Web today.    <br />CGI, Active Server Pages: CGI (Common Gateway Interface) refers to a specification by    <br />which programs can communicate with a Web server. A CGI program, or script, is any program    <br />designed to accept and return data that conforms to the CGI specification. The program can be    <br />written in any programming language, including C, Perl, and Visual Basic Script. A common use    <br />for a CGI script is to process an interactive form on a Web page. For example, you might fill out    <br />a form ordering a book through Interlibrary Loan. The script processes your information and    <br />sends it to a designated e-mail address in the Interlibrary Loan department.    <br />Anther type of dynamically generated Web page is called Active Server Pages (ASP).    <br />Developed by Microsoft, ASPs are HTML pages that include scripting and create interactive    <br />Web server applications. The scripts run on the server, rather than on the Web browser, to    <br />generate the HTML pages sent to browsers. Visual Basic and JScript (a subset of JavaScript) are    <br />often used for the scripting. ASPs end in the file extension .asp.    <br />Java/Java Applets: Java is probably the most famous of the programming languages of the    <br />Web. Java is an object-oriented programming language similar to C++. Developed by Sun    <br />Microsystems, the aim of Java is to create programs that will be platform independent. The Java    <br />motto is, &quot;Write once, run anywhere.&quot; A perfect Java program should work equally well on a PC,    <br />Macintosh, Unix, and so on, without any additional programming. This goal has yet to be    <br />realized. Java can be used to write applications for both Web and non-Web use.    <br />Web-based Java applications are usually in the form of Java applets. These are small Java    <br />programs called from an HTML page that can be downloaded from a Web server and run on a    <br />Java-compatible Web browser. A few examples include live newsfeeds, moving images with    <br />sound, calculators, charts and spreadsheets, and interactive visual displays. Java applets can tend    <br />to load slowly, but programming improvements should lead to a shortened loading time.    <br />JavaScript/JScript: JavaScript is a programming language created by Netscape Communications.    <br />Small programs written in this language are embedded within an HTML page, or called externally    <br />from the page, to enhance the page's the functionality. Examples of JavaScript include moving tickers,    <br />drop-down menus, real-time calendars and clocks, and mouse-over interactions. JScript is a similar    <br />language developed by Microsoft and works with the company's Internet Explorer browser.    <br />VRML: VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) allows for the creation of three-dimensional    <br />words. These may be linked from Web pages and displayed with a VRML viewer. Netscape    <br />Communicator comes with the Cosmo viewer for experiencing these three-dimensional worlds. One of    <br />the most interesting aspects of VRML is the option to &quot;enter&quot; the world and control your movements    <br />within the world.    <br />XML: XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a Web page creation language that enables</p>
<p>designers to create their own customized tags to provide functionality not available with HTML.   <br />XML is a language of data structure and exchange, and allows developers to separate form from    <br />content. At present, this language is little used as Web browsers are only beginning to support it.    <br />In May 1999, however, the W3 Consortium announced that HTML 4.0 has been recast as an    <br />XML application called XHTML. This move will have a significant impact on the future of both    <br />XML and HTML.    <br />Text, audio and video communication can occur in real time on the Web. This capability    <br />allows people to conference and collaborate in real time. In general, the faster the Internet    <br />connection, the more successful the experience.    <br />At its simplest, chat programs allow multiple users to type to each other in real time.    <br />Internet Relay Chat and America Online's Instant Messenger are prime examples of this type of    <br />program. The development of a messaging protocol is underway. Such a protocol would allow    <br />for the expansion of this capability throughout the Internet.    <br />More enhanced real-time communication offers an audio and/or video component. CU-See    <br />Me is one of the most popular software programs of this type. Even more elaborate are programs    <br />that allow for true real-time collaboration. Microsoft's NetMeeting and Netscape's Conference    <br />(available with Communicator) are good examples of this.    <br />Featured collaboration tools include:    <br />audio: conduct a telephone conversation on the Web;    <br />video: view your audience;    <br />file transfer: send files back and forth among participants;    <br />chat: type in real time;    <br />whiteboard: draw, mark up, and save images on a shared window or board.    <br />document/application sharing: view and use a program on another's desktop machine.    <br />collaborative Web browsing: visit Web pages together.    <br />Currently no standard exists that will work among all conferencing programs.    <br />Push: Push refers to a technology that sends data to a program without the program's request.    <br />This is the opposite of the typical &quot;pull&quot; of the Web, in which the user clicks on a link to request    <br />a file from a server. With push, the data is sent automatically. Content is sent through a &quot;channel&quot;.    <br />The early Web-based implementation of push was commercial. Push can also be used to deliver    <br />software upgrades to a desktop machine.</p>
