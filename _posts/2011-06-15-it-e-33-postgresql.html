<p>PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) based on   <br />POSTGRES, Version 4.2, developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer    <br />Science Department. POSTGRES <font color="#0000ff">pioneered</font> many concepts that only became available in some    <br />commercial database systems much later.    <br />Features PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. It    <br />supports SQL92 and SQL99 and offers many modern features:    <br /> complex queries    <br /> foreign keys    <br /> triggers    <br /> views    <br /> transactional integrity    <br /> multiversion concurrency control    <br />Additionally, PostgreSQL can be extended by the user in many ways, for exampleby    <br />adding new</p>
<p> data types   <br /> functions    <br /> operators    <br /> aggregate functions    <br /> index methods    <br /> procedural languages    <br />And because of the liberal license, PostgreSQL can be used, modified, and distributed by    <br />everyone free of charge for any purpose, be it private, commercial, or academic.</p>
<p>Advantages PostgreSQL offers many advantages for your company or business over other   <br />database systems.    <br />1) Immunity to over-deployment    <br />Over-deployment is what some <font color="#0000ff">proprietary</font> database vendors regard as their #1 licence    <br />compliance problem. With PostgreSQL, no-one can sue you for breaking licensing agreements,    <br />as there is no associated licensing cost for the software.    <br />This has several additional advantages:    <br /> More profitable business models with wide-scale deployment.    <br /> No possibility of being audited for license compliance at any stage.    <br /> Flexibility to do concept research and trial deployments without needing to include    <br />additional licensing costs.    <br />2) Better support than the proprietary vendors    <br />In addition to our strong support offerings, we have a vibrant community of PostgreSQL    <br />professionals and enthusiasts that your staff can draw upon and contribute to.    <br />3) Significant saving on staffing costs    <br />Our software has been designed and created to have much lower maintenance and tuning    <br />requirements than the leading proprietary databases, yet still retain all of the features, stability,    <br />and performance.    <br />In addition to this our training programs are generally regarded as being far more cost    <br />effective, manageable, and practical in the real world than that of the leading proprietary database    <br />vendors.    <br />4) Legendary reliability and stability    <br />Unlike many proprietary databases, it is extremely common for companies to report that    <br />PostgreSQL has never, ever crashed for them in several years of high activity operation. Not    <br />even once. It just works.    <br />5) Extensible    <br />The source code is available to all at no charge. If your staff have a need to customise or    <br />extend PostgreSQL in any way then they are able to do so with a minimum of effort, and with no    <br />attached costs. This is complemented by the community of PostgreSQL professionals and    <br />enthusiasts around the globe that also actively extend PostgreSQL on a daily basis.    <br />6) Cross platform    <br />PostgreSQL is available for almost every brand of Unix (34 platforms with the latest stable    <br />release), and Windows compatibility is available via the Cygwin framework. Native Windows    <br />compatibility is also available with version 8.0 and above.    <br />7) Designed for high volume environments    <br />We use a multiple row data storage strategy called MVCC to make PostgreSQL extremely    <br />responsive in high volume environments. The leading proprietary database vendor uses this    <br />technology as well, for the same reasons.    <br />8) GUI database design and administration tools</p>
<p>Several high quality GUI tools exist to both administer the database (pgAdmin, pgAccess)   <br />and do database design (Tora, Data Architect).</p>
