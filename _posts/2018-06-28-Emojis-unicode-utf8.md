Today I read a [interesting article](https://preethisam.com/2018/06/25/how-to-use-emojis-as-icons/) that make the unicode emojis as icon on a web page.

It is cool, and I realized that now emojis are well-supported in the internet.

## What's Emojis
Emojis are unicode text that can show as image in the text message, web on the computer, it created from Japan.

## UTF-8,UTF-16...
As to web, mostly it is utf-8 encoding, so recall what's the difference of UTF-8(UTF-16...) from UNICODE?

Simply to say,  UTF-16 and UTF-8 are both encodings of Unicode. They are both Unicode; one is not more Unicode than the other.UTF-8 is able to use 4 bytes to represents all the UNICODE while UTF-16 also need 4 bytes to represents all UNICODE.

## Use Emojis

On MAC,Command + Control + Spacebar will show the emojis panel.
