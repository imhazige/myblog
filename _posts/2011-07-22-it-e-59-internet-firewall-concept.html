<p>A packet filter is often used to protect an organization's computers and networks from   <br />unwanted Internet traffic. The filter is placed in the router that connects the organization to the    <br />rest of the Internet.    <br />A packet filter configured to protect an organization against traffic from the rest of the    <br />Internet is called an Internet firewall; the term is derived from the fireproof physical boundary    <br />placed between two structures to prevent fire from moving between them. Like a conventional    <br />firewall, an Internet firewall is designed to keep problems in the Internet from spreading to an    <br />organization's computers.    <br />Firewalls are the most important security tool used to handle network connections between    <br />two organizations that do not trust each other. By placing a firewall on each external network    <br />connection, an organization can define a secure <font color="#0000ff">perimeter</font> that prevents outsiders from <font color="#0000ff">interfering</font>    <br />with the organization's computers. In particular, by limiting access to a small set of computers, a    <br />firewall can prevent outsiders from probing all computers in an organization or flooding the    <br />organization's network with unwanted traffic.</p>
<p>A firewall can lower the cost of providing security. Without a firewall to prevent access,   <br />outsiders can send packets to arbitrary computers in an organization. Consequently, to provide    <br />security, an organization must make all of its computer secure. With a firewall, however, a    <br />manager can restrict incoming packets to a small set of computers. In the extreme case, the set    <br />can contain a single computer. Although computers in the set must be secure, other computers in    <br />the organization do not need to be. Thus, an organization can save money because it is less    <br />expensive to install a firewall than to make all computer systems secure.</p>
