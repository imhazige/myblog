<p>The issue of information security and data privacy is assuming <font color="#0000ff">tremendous</font> importance among     <br />global organizations, particularly in an environment marked by computer virus and terrorist attacks,     <br />hackings and destruction of vital data owing to natural disasters. [1] When it comes to information     <br />security, most companies fall somewhere between two extreme boundaries: complete access and     <br />complete security. A completely secure computer is one that is not connected to any network and     <br />physically unreachable by anyone. A computer like this is unusable and does not serve much of a     <br />practical purpose. On the other hand, a computer with complete access is very easy to use, requiring     <br />no passwords or authorization to provide any information. [2] Unfortunately, having a computer with     <br />complete access is also not practical because it would expose every bit of information publicly,     <br />from customer records to financial documents. Obviously, there is a middle ground this is the art     <br />of information security.     <br />The concept of information security is centered on the following components:     <br />Integrity: gathering and maintaining accurate information and avoiding <font color="#0000ff">malicious</font> modification     <br />Availability: providing access to the information when and where desired     <br />Confidentiality: avoiding <font color="#0000ff">disclosure</font> to unauthorized or unwanted persons     <br />For an information system to be secure, it must have a number of properties:     <br />[3] service integrity. This is a property of an information system whereby its availability,     <br />reliability, completeness and <font color="#0000ff">promptness</font> are assured;     <br />data integrity. This is a property whereby records are authentic, reliable, complete, unaltered     <br />and useable, and the processes that operate on them are reliable, compliant with regulatory     <br />requirements, comprehensive, systematic, and prevent unauthorized access, destruction, alteration     <br />or removal of records. These requirements apply to machine-readable databases, files and archives,     <br />and to manual records;     <br />data secrecy . This is a property of an information system whereby information is available     <br />only to those people authorized to receive it. Many sources discuss secrecy as though it was only     <br />an issue during the transmission of data; but it is just as vital in the context of data storage and     <br />data use;     <br />authentication. Authentication is a property of an information system whereby assertions     <br />are checked. Forms of assertion that are subjected to authentication include:     <br />&quot;data authentication&quot;, whereby captured data's authenticity, accuracy, timeliness,     <br />completeness and other quality aspects are checked;     <br />&quot;identity authentication&quot;, <font color="#0000ff">whereby</font> an entity's claim as to its identity is checked.</p>
<p>This applies to all of the following:    <br />the identity of a person;     <br />the identity of an organizational entity;     <br />the identity of a software agent; and     <br />the identity of a device.     <br />&quot;attribute authentication&quot;, whereby an entity's claim to have a particular attribute is     <br />checked, typically by inspecting a &quot;credential&quot;. Of especial <font color="#0000ff">relevance</font> in advanced     <br />electronic communications is claim of being an authorized agent, i.e. an assertion by a     <br />person, a software agent or a device to represent an organization or a person.     <br />Non-repudiation. This is a property of an information system whereby an entity is unable     <br />to convincingly deny an action it has taken.     <br />There is a strong tendency in the information systems security literature to focus on the     <br />security of data communications. But security is important throughout the information life-cycle,     <br />i.e. during the collection, storage, processing, use and disclosure phases, as well as transmission.     <br />Each of the properties of a secure system identified above needs to be applied to all of the     <br />information life-cycle phases.</p>
