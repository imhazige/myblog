<p>This course is an introduction to the basic concepts as well as applications of the rapidly    <br />emerging field of digital image processing. It familiarizes the audience with the understanding,     <br />design, and implementation of algorithms in the various subareas of digital image processing     <br />such as image enhancement, image <font color="#0000ff">deblurring</font>, image understanding, image security, and image     <br />compression. Over 200 image examples complement the technical descriptions.     <br />Benefits/Learning Objectives     <br />This course will enable you to     <br />explain the fundamental concepts and terminologies employed in digital imaging such as     <br />sampling and aliasing, <font color="#0000ff">perceptual</font> <font color="#0000ff">quantization</font>; filtering, look-up tables, image <font color="#0000ff">histogram</font>,     <br />etc;</p>
<p>explain the various techniques used in image enhancement for contrast manipulation (e.g.,    <br />histogram equalization), sharpening (e.g., unsharp masking) and noise removal (e.g.,     <br />selective averaging, median filtering);     <br />briefly demonstrate the performance of image deblurring algorithms such as inverse filtering     <br />and Wiener filtering by using image examples;     <br />briefly demonstrate the concepts behind digital signatures for image authentication and     <br />invisible watermarking for image copyright protection;     <br />briefly describe the current research topics in image understanding and demonstrate related     <br />algorithm performances using image examples;     <br />explain the basic technologies that serve the existing JPEG and the emerging JPEG2000     <br />standards.     <br />Intended Audience     <br />Scientists, engineers, and managers who need to understand and/or apply the fundamental     <br />concepts and techniques employed in digital image processing. Although no particular background is     <br />needed, some prior knowledge of linear system theory (e.g., Fourier transforms) would be helpful.</p>
