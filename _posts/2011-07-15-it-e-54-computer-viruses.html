<p>Just as human viruses <font color="#0000ff">invade</font> a living cell and then turn it into a factory for manufacturing    <br />viruses, computer viruses are small program that <font color="#0000ff">replicate</font> by attaching a copy of themselves to    <br />another program. Once attached to the host program, the virus then lock for other programs to    <br />&quot;infect&quot;. In this way, the virus can spread quickly throughout a hard disk or an entire organization if</p>
<p>it infects a LAN (Local Area Network) or a multi-users system.   <br />[2] Skillfully written virus can infect and multiply for weeks or months without being detected.    <br />During that time, system backups duplicate the viruses, or copies of data or programs made and    <br />passed to other systems to infect. At some pointdetermined by how the virus was programmed    <br />the virus attacks. The timing of the attack can be linked to a number of situations, including: a    <br />certain time or date; the presence of a particular user ID; the use or presence of a particular file; the    <br />security privilege level of the user; and the number of times of a file is used.    <br />Likewise, the mode of attack varies, so-called &quot;being&quot; viruses might simply display a    <br />message, like the one that infected IBM's main computer system last Christmas with a season's    <br />greeting.    <br />Malignant viruses, on the other hand, are designed to damage your system. One common    <br />attack is to wipe out data, to delete files, or to perform a format of disk.    <br />There are four main types of viruses: shell, intrusive, operating system, and source code.    <br /> Shell viruses wrap themselves around a host and do not modify the original program.    <br />Shell program are easy to write, which is why about half of all viruses are of this type. In    <br />addition, shell viruses are easy for programs like Data Physician to remove.    <br /> Intrusive viruses invade an existing program and actually insert a portion of themselves    <br />into the host program. Intrusive viruses are hard to write and difficult to remove without    <br />damaging the host file.    <br />Shell and intrusive viruses most commonly attack executable program filethose with.    <br />COM or. EXE extensionalthough data are also at some risk.    <br /> Operating system viruses work by replacing parts of operating system with their own    <br />logic. [4]Very difficult to write, these viruses have the ability, once booted up, to take    <br />total control of your system. According to Digital Dispatch, known versions of operating    <br />system viruses have hidden large amounts of attack logic in falsely marked bad disk    <br />sectors. Others install RAM-resident programs or device drivers to perform infection or    <br />attack functions invisibly from memory.    <br /> [5]Source code viruses are intrusive programs that are inserted into a source program    <br />such    <br />as those written in Pascal prior to the program being compiled. These are the least    <br />common viruses because they are not only hard to write, but also have a limited number    <br />of hosts compared to the other types.    <br />New computer viruses are written all the time, and it's important to understand how your    <br />system can be exposed to them and what can do to protect your computer. Follow the suggestions    <br />listed below to substantially decrease the danger of infecting your computer system with a    <br />potentially dangerous computer virus.    <br /> Be very cautious about inserting disks from unknown sources into your computer.    <br /> Always scan the disk's files before operating any of them.    <br /> Only download Internet files from reputable sites.</p>
<p> Do not open e-mail attachments (especially executable files) from strangers.   <br /> Purchase, install, and use an anti-virus software program. The program you choose must    <br />provide three functions:    <br /> Detection.    <br /> Prevention.    <br /> Removal.    <br />As new viruses are created everyday, upgrade your anti-virus software regularly.</p>
