<p>A &quot;Software Development Kit&quot;, or &quot;SDK&quot; for short, is typically a set of development tools   <br />that allows a software engineer to create applications for a certain software package, software    <br />framework, hardware platform, computer system, operating system or similar. It may be something    <br />as simple as an application programming interface in the form of some files to interface to a    <br />particular programming language, or include sophisticated hardware to communicate with a certain    <br />embedded system. Common tools include debugging aids and other utilities. SDKs also    <br />frequently include sample code and supporting technical notes or other supporting documentation    <br />to help clarify points from the primary reference material. A software engineer typically receives    <br />the SDK from the target system developer. Oftentimes, the SDK can be downloaded directly via    <br />the Internet. Many SDKs are provided for free to encourage developers to use the system or    <br />language. Sometimes this is used as a marketing tool. For example, &quot;Foo Products&quot; might    <br />provide the &quot;Widget SDK&quot; for free to encourage people to use it. Thus, more people will be    <br />encouraged to buy more of their widgets since they can program them for free. SDKs may have    <br />attached licenses that make them unsuitable for building software intended to be developed under    <br />an incompatible license. For example, a proprietarySDK will likely be incompatible with Free    <br />software development. And a GPL licensed SDK will &quot;likely&quot; be incompatible with proprietary    <br />software development. LGPL SDKs are typically safe for proprietary development. An SDK for    <br />an operating system add-on (for instance, QuickTime for Mac OS) may include the add-on</p>
<p>software itself, to be used for development purposes, if not necessarily for redistribution. An</p>
<p>interesting situation arises here between platforms where it is possible to develop applications</p>
<p>that can at least start up on a system configuration without the add-on installed, and use a</p>
<p>Gestalt-style run-time &quot;environment query&quot; to determine if the add-on is present, and ones where   <br />the application will simply fail to start. In other words, it is possible to build a single binary that    <br />will run on configurations with and without the add-on present, albeitoperating with reduced    <br />functionality in the latter situation.</p>
