<p>You've perhaps heard about something called scripting, or maybe you've heard of languages   <br />like JavaScript, VBScript, Tcl and others (those languages are called scripting languages). You    <br />may thus be wondering if scripting is the same as programming, and/or what the differences are,    <br />and so on. People get quite passionate about this question, so I'm just going to cover it briefly and    <br />technically. Here are some facts:    <br /> Scripting is essentially a type of programming.    <br /> Scripting languages have a few minor technical differences which aren't important to    <br />discuss at this point.    <br /> Scripting languages tend to be interpreted rather than compiled, which means that you    <br />don't need to compile them. they're compiled &quot;on the fly&quot; (i.e. when necessary, right    <br />before they're run). This can make it faster to program in them (since you always have    <br />the source code, and don't need to take the <font color="#0000ff">deliberate </font>extra step of compiling).    <br /> The fact that scripting languages are interpreted generally makes them slower than.programming    <br />languages for intensive operations (like complex calculations).    <br /> Scripting languages are often easier to learn than programming languages, but usually    <br />aren't as powerful or flexible.    <br /> For programming things like applications for personal computers, you'll need to use a    <br />programming language rather than a scripting language.    <br />Scripting languages can be excellent for beginners: they tend to be easier to learn, and they    <br />insulate you from some of the technical aspects of programming (compiling, for one). However,    <br />if you're serious about programming, you won't be able to stay with a scripting language forever    <br />you will move on to a programming language at some point. I'd say that it's good to know a    <br />scripting language or two, and even to start with a scripting language rather than a programming    <br />language. However, there's a point of view which says that, by protecting and &quot;hand-holding&quot; too    <br />much, scripting languages don't properly prepare you for &quot;serious&quot; programming, and set you up    <br />for a bit of a learning curve when you move on to a programming language.</p>
