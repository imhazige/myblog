<p>It might be a stretch to call the recent &quot;Melissa&quot; virus a positive event because it <font color="#0000ff">disrupted</font>    <br />thousands o government and commercial computer systems. But it did put the focus on content    <br />filtering, a network security technology that observers say has been undervalued. In the long run,    <br />many believe this new focus will prove beneficial to users.    <br />As a macro virus attached to an e-mailed Microsoft Corp. Word document, Melissa would    <br />not have been picked up by traditional security solutions such as firewalls or intrusion-detection    <br />systems, which are designed to detect items that break certain global access rules. The only way    <br />to detect a virus such as Melissa is to examine what is inside the e-mail, which can only be done    <br />through content filtering, supporters of the technology said.    <br />Filtering products have been around for years, but manufacturers have been struggling to    <br />meet the needs of organizations that employ varying security policies among different users.    <br />Recently, however, vendors have released filtering products that can be tailored to the needs of    <br />user groups, and industry has begun working on standards that allow these products to work with    <br />firewalls.    <br />Content filtering encompasses several areas of protection. As well as guarding against    <br />viruses, it includes:    <br />E-mail filtering, which controls incoming e-mail that contains spam, file attachments that    <br />are too large or <font color="#0000ff">hoax</font> e-mails. It also can be used internally to make sure confidential information    <br />is not accidentally or intentionally sent outside of the organization.    <br />Uniform Resource Locator filtering, which blocks access to inappropriate sites not connected    <br />to a user's work needs.    <br />Malicious-code protection, which prevents hostile code embedded in Java and ActiveX    <br />scripts in otherwise innocuous World Wide Web pages from reaching the user's browser and</p>
<p>being executed.   <br />The most obvious benefit of filtering products is the ability to <font color="#0000ff">boost</font> network security, but    <br />many organizations also use them for internal network control. For example, URL filters can be    <br />used to block access to certain sites and to maintain productivity. Message Inspector, an e-mail    <br />filter produced by Elron Software Inc. uses context-sensitive filtering to weed out offensive or    <br />sensitive communications in e-mail, newsgroups or FTP sites. Message Inspector is an example    <br />of the newer generation of filter products that examine messages for words and phrases used in    <br />conjunction with each other to narrow the range of filter targets. This strategy differs from the    <br />one employed by traditional products that block communications based on factors such as    <br />keywordsa process that can generate a lot of &quot;false positive&quot; alarms.    <br />Melissa presented a clear idea of why people need a gateway-based virus-detection product,    <br />&quot;Viruses need to be kept out of the enterprise altogether because you just can't update all    <br />virus-detection software on desktops in time to catch them.&quot;    <br />The International Computer Security Association is working on what it calls the Common    <br />Content Inspection program to define a general application program interface (API) that would    <br />enable filter vendors to fit their products to a range of firewalls.</p>
