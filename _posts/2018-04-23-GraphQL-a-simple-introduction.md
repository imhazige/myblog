## GraphQL: a simple introduction

### What's GraphQL

From [https://github.com/facebook/graphql](https://github.com/facebook/graphql): 

> GraphQL is a query language and execution engine tied to any backend service. http://graphql.org/ 

> A query language for APIs created by Facebook. 

### [The Spec](https://github.com/facebook/graphql)

### Open source

[express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) - Create a GraphQL HTTP server with Express.

[GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) - GraphQL.js is a general purpose library and can be used both in a Node server and in the browser.

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/) - A graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE.

### Concern about the performance

[GraphQL APIs and performance](https://brandur.org/fragments/graphql-performance)

> It’s true that performance can be a challenge, but it’s not true that GraphQL somehow forces you to expose routes that are not performant. A GraphQL schema is designed the same way as your traditional REST-ish API in that a service operator only reveals routes where they can ensure good quality of service for users, and good stability for their own backend.

### What's [GraphQL Appollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)

> Build a universal GraphQL API on top of your existing REST APIs, so you can ship new application features fast without waiting on backend changes.
