## GraphQL: a simple introduction

### What's GraphQL

From [https://github.com/facebook/graphql](https://github.com/facebook/graphql): 

> GraphQL is a query language and execution engine tied to any backend service. http://graphql.org/ 

> A query language for APIs created by Facebook. 

### [The Spec](https://github.com/facebook/graphql)

### Open source



### Concern about the performance

[GraphQL APIs and performance](https://brandur.org/fragments/graphql-performance)

> It’s true that performance can be a challenge, but it’s not true that GraphQL somehow forces you to expose routes that are not performant. A GraphQL schema is designed the same way as your traditional REST-ish API in that a service operator only reveals routes where they can ensure good quality of service for users, and good stability for their own backend.
