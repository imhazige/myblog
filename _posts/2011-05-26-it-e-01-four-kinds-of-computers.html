<p>Computers are electronic devices that can follow instructions to accept input, process that   <br />input, and produce information. There are four types of computers: microcomputers, minicomputers,    <br />mainframe computers, and supercomputers.    <br />Microcomputers, also known as personal computers, are small computers that can fit on a desktop.    <br />Portable microcomputers can fit in a briefcase or even in the palm of your hand. Microcomputers are    <br />used in homes, schools, and industry. Today nearly every field uses microcomputers.    <br />One type of microcomputer that is rapidly growing in popularity is the portable computer,    <br />which can be easily carried around. There are four categories of portable computers.    <br />Laptops: laptops, which weigh between 10 and 16 pounds, may be AC-powered, battery-powered,    <br />or both. The AC-powered laptop weighs 12 to 16 pounds. The battery-powered laptop weighs 10 to 15    <br />pounds, batteries included, and can be carried on a shoulder strap.    <br />Notebook PCs: notebook personal computers weigh between 5 and 10 pounds and can fit    <br />into most briefcases. It is especially valuable in locations where electrical connections are not    <br />available. Notebook computers are the most popular portable computers today.    <br />Subnotebooks: subnotebooks are for frequent flyers and life-on-the-road types.[1] Subnotebooks    <br />users give up a full-size display screen and keyboard in exchange for less weight. Weighting between    <br />2 and 6 pounds, these computer fit easily into a briefcase.    <br />Personal Digital Assistants: much smaller than even the subnotebooks. Personal Digital    <br />Assistants (PDAs) weigh from 1 to 4 pounds. The typical PDA combines pen input, writing    <br />recognition, personal organizational tools, and communication capabilities in a very small    <br />package.    <br />Minicomputers, also knows as midrange computers, are desk-sized machines. [2]They fall into    <br />between microcomputers and mainframes in their processing speeds and data-storing capacities.    <br />Medium-size companies or departments of large companies typically use them for specific purposes.    <br />For example, they might use them to do research or to monitor a particular manufacturing process.    <br />Smaller-size companies typically use microcomputers for their general data processing needs, such as    <br />accounting.    <br />Mainframe computers are larger computers occupying specially wired, air-conditioned rooms    <br />and capable of great processing speeds and data storage. They are used by large organizations    <br />business, banks, universities, government agencies—to handle millions of transactions. For    <br />example, insurance companies use mainframes to process information about millions of policyholders.    <br />Supercomputers are special, high-capacity computers used by very large organizations principally    <br />for research purposes. Among their uses are oil exploration and worldwide weather forecasting.    <br />In general, a computer's type is determined by the following seven factors:</p>
<p>The type of CPU. Microcomputers use microprocessors. The larger computers tend to use   <br />CPUs made up of separate, high-speed, sophisticated components.    <br />The amount of main memory the CPU can use. A computer equipped with a large    <br />amount of main memory can support more sophisticated programs and can even hold several    <br />different programs in memory at the same time.    <br />The capacity of the storage devices. The larger computers systems tend to be equipped    <br />with higher capacity storage devices.    <br />The speed of the output devices. [3]The speed of microcomputer output devices tends to be    <br />rated in terms of the number of characters per second (cps) that can be printed usually in tens    <br />and hundreds of cps. Larger computers' output devices are faster and are usually rated at speeds    <br />of hundreds or thousands of lines that can be printed per minute.    <br />The processing speed in millions of instructions per second (mips). The term instruction    <br />is used here to describe a basic task the software asks the computer to perform while also    <br />identifying the data to be affected. The processing speed of the smaller computers ranges from 7    <br />to 40 mips. The speed of large computers can be 30 to 150 mips or more, and supercomputers    <br />can process more than 200 mips. In other words, a mainframe computer can process your data a    <br />great deal faster than a microcomputer can.    <br />The number of users that can access the computer at one time. Most small computers    <br />can support only a single user, some can support as many as two or three at a time. Large    <br />computers can support hundreds of users simultaneously.    <br />The cost of the computer system. Business systems can cost as little as $500 (for a    <br />microcomputer) or as much as $10 million (for a mainframe) and much more for supercomputer.</p>
