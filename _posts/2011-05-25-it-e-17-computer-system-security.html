<p>Please notice that the term computer system here includes hardware, software, network   <br />transmission paths, and people who interact with these components. By this definition,    <br />everything from a desktop workstation to the Internet qualifies as a computer system.    <br />An attacker is a person who tries to gain an advantage by exploiting a security hole.    <br />Attackers are misfeasors, masqueraders, or clandestine users.    <br />Misfeasors </p>
<p>These authorized users gain additional but unauthorized access to resources on   <br />a system or otherwise misuse their authorization. Examples include programmers who use their    <br />accounts to exploit operating system (OS) vulnerabilities and gain administrative privileges, or    <br />accountants who embezzlemoney by falsifying records in a database to which they have regular    <br />access. A misfeasor is an &quot;inside&quot; person, someone within an organization who introduces a    <br />security risk or poses a threat.    <br />Masqueraders </p>
<p>These people use authorized user access privileges to enter a system and   <br />then, posing as that user, attack the system. Examples include hackers who obtain usernames and    <br />passwords by cracking password files, and then use that information to gain entry to the system.    <br />Masqueraders are usually persons outside the organization.    <br />Clandestine Users </p>
<p>These individuals are insiders or outsiders who obtain their own, distinct   <br />unauthorized access to a system. Examples include hackers who obtain administrative access to a    <br />system long enough to create their own user accounts for subsequent access.    <br />The concepts of access and authorization are not necessarily limited to user accounts within    <br />an OS. Physical access to an equipment closet or authorization to place orders for new telephony    <br />service are examples of other types of access and authorization. All persons who have any degree    <br />of physical or logical interaction with a system, its components, or its processes are capable of    <br />compromising system security.</p>
<p>The goals of an attacker range from innocuous to severely damaging:   <br />Trophy Grabbing </p>
<p>Most thrill-seeking attackers are trophy grabbing. Their intent is not to   <br />disrupt or damage a system, but to prove that they can enter the system. Such accomplishments    <br />are badges of achievement in the hacker community.    <br />Information Theft </p>
<p>The most common goal of a security attack is information theft. Intruders   <br />seek sensitive information such as credit card numbers, usernames, passwords, and medical records.    <br />Service Theft </p>
<p>This type of attack involves attackers who use computer resources without   <br />paying for them. Software pirates who crack systems to host stolen software, or warez, for others    <br />to download are guilty of service theft. Clandestine users also commit service theft by having    <br />unauthorized accounts on a server.    <br />Identity Theft </p>
<p>This is the act of illegally assuming the identity of another person, or   <br />masquerading, to gain control of that person's resources (usually computer and economic    <br />privileges). An example of this is an attacker who uses stolen social security numbers and credit    <br />histories to establish and exercise unauthorized lines of credit. Identity theft does not necessarily    <br />involve information theft. For example, an attacker can commit e-mail forgerywithout stealing    <br />sensitive information about the e-mail address owner.    <br />Tampering </p>
<p>This attack is more serious than information theft because the attacker alters   <br />data rather than simply copying it. A student who changes a grade in a university registrar's    <br />database is tampering. This example is stealthy tampering/the attack is not intended to draw    <br />attention. A more extreme form of tampering is defacement, in which a hacker alters a system in    <br />a very noticeable way, usually to make a personal or political statement. The disgruntled    <br />computer operator who, upon dismissal, embeds nasty messages about management in a login    <br />script, or the activist group that hacks into a corporate Web site are typical examples.    <br />Denial of Service (DoS) </p>
<p>DoS can be the most damaging type of security attack. It   <br />diminishes server capacity for authorized clients and temporarily disrupts access to the system. In    <br />the worst cases, DoS attacks render a system unusable for a protracted period by destroying not    <br />only its ability to communicate, but also any data that has been entrusted to it. DoS also can    <br />occur as an unintentional side effect of service theft. For example, hosting pirated warez can    <br />bring down a system because of the excessive download activity.</p>
<p>Although attackers continue to create new methods for violating computer system security,   <br />the vulnerabilities they exploit remain the same. These vulnerabilities can be divided into five    <br />types:    <br />Implicit Trust </p>
<p>The unquestioning, unchecked acceptance of a person or agent. Attacks that   <br />exploit this vulnerability include: compromised system utilities, e-mail forgery, IP spoofing,    <br />keystroke monitoring, logic bomb, masquerading, shoulder surfing, social engineering, Trojan    <br />horse, trapdoor.</p>
<p>A defense is a countermeasurefor dealing with security attacks. Administrators can employ   <br />five types of defenses:    <br />ObfuscationConfusing the attacker by obscuring publicly available information that exposes    <br />vulnerability. Examples include: anonymity, encryption, packet stuffing, public key cryptography,    <br />shielding, steganography, trash disposal.    <br />Authentication and Authorization Ensuring that a person or system claiming an identity is    <br />the real owner of the identity, and granting access on a &quot;must have&quot; basis. Examples include:    <br />badges and cards, biometrics, password, shared secret, signature, watermark.    <br />Monitoring and Auditing Observing system vulnerabilities, either in real time or through    <br />audit tools, to detect attacks. Examples include: filtering, firewall, integrity check, intrusion    <br />detection, misuse detection, password checker, peer review, process review, security audit tools,    <br />virus detection.    <br />Currency Consistently using tested software updates and periodically reviewing human    <br />processes and procedures. Examples include: patching, process review, upgrading.    <br />Education and Enforcement Effectively equipping system designers and users with    <br />knowledge of security risks, and then enforcing application of this knowledge. Examples include:    <br />reminders, tip of the day, training.    <br />The key to preventing security attacks from diminishing system performance is knowledge.    <br />IT administrators can develop their security strategies by studying historical and contemporary    <br />attacks, appropriate defenses, and the evolving trends in the computer security industry.</p>
