<p>A dial peer, also known as an addressable call endpoint, is a device that can originate or   <br />receive a call in a telephone network. In voice over IP (VoIP), addressable call endpoints can be    <br />categorized as either voice-network dial peers or POTS (plain old telephone service) dial peers.    <br />Voice-network dial peers include VoIP-capable computers, routers, and gateways within a    <br />network. POTS dial peers include traditional phone sets, cell phones, and fax machines.    <br />The term dial peer is sometimes used in reference to a program that matches a specific    <br />dialed sequence of digits to an addressable call endpoint. According to this definition, there is    <br />one dial peer for each call leg (connection between two addressable call endpoints).    <br />Dial peer hunting is a feature of voice over IP(VoIP) systems in which the device at the    <br />originating router attempts to find an alternative addressable call endpoint if it cannot establish a    <br />connection to the intended endpoint. For dial peer hunting to work, the originating router must be    <br />configured with a list (sequence) of dial peers, all of which can route a call to the same endpoint,    <br />but using different destination routers. If the originating router receives an invalid-number or    <br />user-busy code from the destination router, the originating router proceeds to the next dial peer    <br />in the sequence.</p>
