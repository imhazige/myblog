<p>The field of digital image processing has experienced continuous and significant expansion   <br />in recent years. The usefulness of this technology is apparent in many different disciplines    <br />covering medicine through <font color="#0000ff">remote sensing【遥感】</font>. The advances and wide availability of image    <br />processing hardware has further enhanced the usefulness of image processing.    <br />Remote sensing is the process of collecting data about objects or landscape features without    <br />coming into direct physical contact with them.    <br />Digital Image Processing is not only a step in the remote sensing process, but is itself a    <br />process that consists of several steps. It is important to remember that the ultimate goal of this    <br />process is to extract information from an image that is not readily apparent or is not available in    <br />its original form. The steps taken in processing an image will vary from image to image for</p>
<p>multiple reasons, including the format and initial condition of the image, the information of   <br />interest (i.e., geologic formations vs. land cover), the composition of scene elements. There are    <br />three general steps in processing a digital image; preprocessing, display and enhancement, and    <br />information extraction.    <br />PreprocessingBefore digital images can be analyzed, they usually require some degree of    <br />preprocessing. This may involve radiometric corrections, which attempt to remove the effects of    <br />sensor errors and/or environmental factors.[1] A common method of determining what errors have    <br />been introduced into an image is by modeling the scene at the time of data acquisition using    <br /><font color="#0000ff">ancillary</font> data collected.    <br />Geometric corrections are also very common prior to any image analysis. If any types of    <br />area, direction or distance measurements are to be made using an image, it must be <font color="#0000ff">rectified</font> if    <br />they are to be accurate.[2] Geometric rectification is a process by which points in an image are    <br />registered to corresponding points on a map or another image that has already been rectified. The    <br />goal of geometric rectification is to put image elements in their proper <font color="#0000ff">planimetric</font> (x and y)    <br />positions.    <br />Information EnhancementThere are numerous procedures that can be performed to    <br />enhance an image. However, they can be classified into two major categories: point operations    <br />and local operations. Point operations change the value of each individual pixel independent of    <br />all other pixel, while local operations change the value of individual pixels in the context of the    <br />values of neighboring pixels. Common enhancements include image reduction, image    <br />magnification, <font color="#0000ff">transect</font> extraction, contrast adjustments (linear and non-linear), band ratioing,    <br />spatial filtering, fourier transformations, principle components analysis, and texture    <br />transformations.    <br />Information ExtractionUnlike analog image processing, digital image processing    <br />presently relies almost wholly on the primary elements of tone and color of image pixels.    <br />There has been some success with expert systems and neural networks which attempt to    <br />enable the computer to <font color="#0000ff">mimic</font> the ways in which humans interpret images. Expert systems    <br />accomplish this through the compilation of a large database of human knowledge gained from    <br /><font color="#0000ff">analog</font> image interpretation which the computer draws upon in its interpretations.[3] Neural    <br />networks attempt to &quot;teach&quot; the computer what decisions to make based upon a training data set.    <br />Once it has &quot;learned&quot; how to classify the training data successfully, it is used to interpret and    <br />classify new data sets.    <br />Once the remotely sensed data has been processed, it must be placed into a format that can    <br />effectively transmit the information it was intended to. This can be done in a variety of ways    <br />including a printout of the enhanced image itself, and image map, a thematic map, a spatial    <br />database, summary statistics and/or graphs. Because there are a variety of ways in which the    <br />output can be displayed, a knowledge not only of remote sensing, but of such fields GIS,    <br />cartography, and spatial statistics are a necessity. With an understanding of these areas and how    <br />they interact one with another, it is possible to produce output that give the user the information</p>
<p>needed without confusion. However, without such knowledge it is more probable that output will   <br />be poor and difficult to use properly, thus wasting the time and effort expended in processing the    <br />remotely sensed data.</p>
