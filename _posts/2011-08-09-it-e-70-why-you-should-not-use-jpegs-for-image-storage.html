<p>If I were king, I'd banish JPEGs forever. JPEGs (pronounced &quot;jay-pegs&quot;, and sometimes   <br />spelled &quot;JPGs&quot;) are the images you see all over the Web. Pictures stored as JPEGs are highly    <br />compressed so they can be sent across the Internet faster. A picture that takes up 1 million bytes    <br />can be squeezed down to 1/10th of that size if you turn it into a JPEG.    <br />That would seem like a good idea. But it's actually a good idea gone bad. JPEGs are like    <br />jigsaw puzzles that can never be put back together again right. Pieces will always be missing.</p>
<p>Every time you change a normal image into a JPEG, you lose part of the picture. You can never   <br />get it back.    <br />Remember that. I'll repeat it in a slightly different way to help out: When you create or save    <br />a JPEG image, you lose part of the picture and you simply can't get it back, ever.    <br />JPEGs are losers. They use what's called &quot;lossy&quot; compression. To squeeze an image's file    <br />size down to something really small, the JPEG process tosses out 80 or 90 percent of the    <br />information and fakes a lot of the rest. JPEGs take advantage of a trick of our eyesight. When we    <br />see part of a small, familiar object, we automatically fill in the rest of it. JPEG processing breaks    <br />an image up into a lot of small pieces and strips out a great deal of detail from each small piece.    <br />A picture of your grandmother holding a <font color="#0000ff">shawl</font> might show every detail ordinarily, but a    <br />JPEG version might not show the way her fingers wrap around the fabric. Instead, they might be    <br />depicted as areas of light and dark contrast that suggest an old woman's fingers. Your eyes and    <br />brain do the rest. They turn what is only a suggestion of fingers into what your brain thinks is the    <br />real thing.    <br />This might be fine for some uses. But anyone who cares about digital photography should    <br />consider JPEG as an enemy, not a friend. I'll bet you don't want that picture of grandma turned    <br />into someone who looks <font color="#0000ff">sorta</font> like grandma. You want the real thing.    <br />JPEGs are one-way trips to the Badlands. Here's a familiar scenario. You have a normal,    <br />non-compressed image. It's a Windows bitmap, maybe. (They're BMP files.) You open this    <br />bitmap in your image-editing software and save it as a JPEG. The file is a lot smaller. You    <br />celebrate a little. What a trick you just pulled!    <br />Later, you realize you need to tweak the picture a little. Maybe you need to crop it. Maybe    <br />you just want to make the colors more vivid.    <br />So you open the JPEG in your image editor, make your changes and save the file as a JPEG    <br />again.    <br />The image you cropped or tweaked can't be the same as the one you started with. It was    <br />already <font color="#0000ff">chopped </font>up a lot by the JPEG processing, and when you saved it again it got chopped and    <br />diced some more.    <br />The PNG image format is the best thing since the wheel. PNG (pronounced &quot;Ping,&quot; not &quot;Pea    <br />En Gee&quot;) means &quot;Portable Network Graphics.&quot; When you save an image as a PNG, nothing gets    <br /><font color="#0000ff">sliced</font> or <font color="#0000ff">diced</font>. A PNG is almost surely going to be smaller than a standard uncompressed image,    <br />but it won't have any wounds. Cut it up all you want, slice it hither and <font color="#0000ff">yon</font>. It will be all there,    <br />even though it's smaller.    <br />This miracle is actually just a trick of counting. We all do the same thing that PNGs do. We    <br />learned this trick in grade school.    <br />Here's how it works. Suppose you have a lot of sheep to count. You could count every    <br />single one of them. Boring, right? Or you could count them by twos. Or maybe, if your eye is    <br />quick, you could count them by threes.    <br />Let's say you've done thismaybe you were trying the old technique of counting sheep to</p>
<p>get to sleep but it didn't workand now it's time to come up with the real number. If you counted   <br />by twos, you just multiply your total by two. If you counted by threes, you multiply your number    <br />by three.    <br />Cool, right? You're storing something like 31 in your brain, but you can quickly turn that    <br />into the real number62 or 93.    <br />It's all shorthand. It's a perfectly sane mathematical trick. PNG uses the same approach. It    <br />squeezes the data in an image file using tricks of math. Does the image have 61 pixels of nothing    <br />but azure blue in one area? PNG stores that information as an instruction to make an azure blue    <br />pixel 61 times. That takes up a lot less space than something like this: azure blue pixel, azure    <br />blue pixel, <font color="#0000ff">azure</font> blue pixel, ... you get the point.    <br />The best part of this trick is the way it can be totally reversed without losses. the sky looks    <br />exactly the way it was supposed to in the image with all those azure blue pixels. Storing    <br />information by listing it as &quot;1 pixel times 61&quot; is the same as storing 61 pixels. Except that it    <br />doesn't take up all that wasted space.    <br />PNGs can't quite <font color="#0000ff">squeeze </font>images as much as JPEGs can. There's no way to do it the lossless    <br />way and get the same reduction in file size. But PNGs can cut an image down to anywhere from    <br />one-half to one-third of its normal file size without any loss of data. Some images can be reduced    <br />even more.    <br />I took a few hundred uncompressed digital images and changed them from BMP to PNG to    <br />find out how much space I could save. Most of them were 12 megabyte files stored as BMPs.    <br />PNG squeezed these scans down to a little less than half their uncompressed size on average.    <br />Some scans, especially ones that did not have much detail, compressed a lot more. But since I    <br />started storing most of my digital images as PNGs, I've come to expect about a 50 percent to 60    <br />percent savings in file space.    <br />That might not seem like much compared to the way JPEG squeezes images, but it's a huge    <br />bonus when you realize that PNG is harmless. Images are not changed in any way.    <br />Good image viewers and editors know how to deal with PNG. If you don't see PNG listed as    <br />an option in your image editor's &quot;Save As&quot; menu (under the &quot;File&quot; menu), you have old software    <br />and should get a newer version.    <br />If you don't have an image viewer of any kind, buy ACDSee, available for both Windows    <br />PCs and Macintoshes.</p>

<p>PNG原来是<strong><font color="#0000ff">无损</font></strong>压缩<strong><font color="#0000ff">位图</font></strong></p>
<p>GIF也是无损压缩位图,只是由于压缩算法专利问题，逐渐被PNG取代。</p>
