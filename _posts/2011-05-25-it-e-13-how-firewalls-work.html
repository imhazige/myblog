<p>Firewalls basically work as a filter between your application and network connection. They   <br />act as gatekeepers and as per your settings, show a port as open or closed for communication.    <br />You can grant rights for different applications to gain access to the internet and also in a reverse    <br />manner by blocking outside applications trying to use ports and protocols and preventing attacks.    <br />Hence you can block ports that you don't use or even block common ports used by Trojans.    <br />Using Firewalls you can also block protocols, so restricting access to NetBIOS will prevent    <br />computers on the network from accessing your data. Firewalls often use a combination of ports,    <br />protocols, and application level security to give you the desired security.    <br />Firewalls are configured to discard packets with particular attributes such as:    <br />Specific source or destination IP addresses.    <br />Specific protocol types.    <br />TCP flags set/clear in the packet header.    <br />Choose the firewalls which have the ability to ward off all intrusion attempts, control    <br />applications that can access the internet, preventing the malicious scripts or controls from    <br />stealing information or uploading files and prevent Trojans and other backdoor agents from    <br />running as servers.    <br />The purpose of having a firewall cannot be diminished in order to gain speed. However,    <br />secure, high-performance firewalls are required to remove the bottleneck when using high speed    <br />Internet connections. The World-Wide-Web makes possible the generation of enormous amounts    <br />of traffic at the click of a mouse.    <br />Most of these firewalls are free for personal use or offer a free trial period. All the personal    <br />firewalls available can't ensure 100% security for your machine. Regular maintenance of the    <br />machine is needed for ensuring safety.</p>
