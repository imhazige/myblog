<p>The modern database era began in 1970, when E.F. Codd published his paper &quot;A Relational   <br />Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.&quot; His ideas enabled the logical manipulation of data    <br />to be independent of its physical location, greatly simplifying the work of application developers.    <br />Now we are <font color="#0000ff">poised </font>for another <font color="#0000ff">leap </font>forward. Databases will scale to <font color="#0000ff">gargantuan proportions</font>,    <br />span multiple locations and maintain information in heterogeneous formats. And they will be    <br />autonomous and self-tuning. The major database vendors are pursuing these goals in different    <br />ways.    <br />Thirty years ago, IBM researcher Selinger invented &quot;cost-based&quot; query optimization, by    <br />which searches against relational databases such as IBM's DB2 minimized computer resources by    <br />finding the most efficient access methods and paths. Now Selinger is leading an effort at IBM    <br />called Leo for Learning Optimizer that she says will push DB2 optimization into a new    <br />realm.    <br />Rather than optimizing a query once, when it's compiled, Leo will watch production queries    <br />as they run and fine-tune them as it learns about data relationships and user needs. For example,    <br />Leo would come to realize that a ZIP code can be associated with only one state, or that a Camry    <br />is made only by Toyota, even if those rules aren't specified in advance.    <br />Selinger says Leo will be most helpful in large and complex databases, and in databases    <br />where interdata relationships exist but aren't explicitly declared by database designers. Leo is    <br />likely to be included in commercial releases of DB2 in about three years, she says.    <br />Whether the future of databases is the traditional, relational and SQL model with XML    <br />technologies incorporated into it or a new XML-based model is a matter of debate. XML will    <br />become the dominant format for data interchange with its flexibility and ability to provide    <br />self-description, according to Don Chamberlin, a database technology researcher at IBM.    <br />Relational databeses, he said, will be fitted with front ends to support XML and process    <br />queries based on the XQuery standard. XML will become the &quot;lingua franca&quot; for exchange of    <br />data. &quot;We'll also see some large relational systems adapt to XML as a native format,&quot;Chamberlin    <br />said.Technologists are in the early stages of development of XML technologies. SQL will not go    <br />away, but there are new data formats for which it just was not designed, he said.    <br />Sun's Rick Cattell, a distinguished engineer at the company, had a less dominant outlook for    <br />XML, saying very few people are going to store XQuery data in an XML format.&quot;I think the    <br /><font color="#0000ff">momentum </font>behind relational databases is <font color="#0000ff">insurmountable</font>,&quot;Cattell said, adding that he was    <br />drawing on his experience with object-oriented databases, which were unable to <font color="#0000ff">unseat</font> relational    <br />databases in enterprise IT shops. Developers, Cattell said, will need tools to convert relational    <br />data to XML and vice versa.    <br />Currently, performance on the Web is hindered because of translations between Java and    <br />XML data formats. Eventually, an extension of XQuery will replace both Java and SQL</p>
<p>according to some experts.   <br />The next step in the evolution of databases is to provide a more powerful way to query them    <br />than what is being done on search sites such as Google today.    <br />Experts are expecting tuple space technology, which is intended to make it easier to store and    <br />fetch data by recognizing patterns. And in-memory databases technology is a &quot;no-brainer,&quot;but there is    <br />not enough memory available yet to accommodate it.    <br />Microsoft Corp. says users will never be <font color="#0000ff">persuaded </font>to dump everything e-mail, documents,    <br />audio/video, pictures, spreadsheets and so on into one <font color="#0000ff">gigantic</font> database. Therefore, the    <br />software vendor is developing technology that will allow a user to seamlessly reach across    <br />multiple, <font color="#0000ff">heterogeneous </font>data stores with a single query.    <br />Microsoft's Unified Data project involves three steps. First, the company will devise    <br />&quot;schema&quot; based on XML that define data types. Then it will develop methods for relating    <br />different data types to each other and finally develop a common query mechanism for distributed    <br />databases. For example, I want to search for a document that references Microsoft, and the    <br />document &quot;tells&quot; the query that there's also a media file in another place that references    <br />Microsoft.    <br />The technology will appear in 18 months in SQL Server. It will be added to other Microsoft    <br />products in <font color="#0000ff">ensuing</font> years.    <br />Oracle Corp. says its customers are moving toward data stores of huge size and complexity,    <br />spread over multiple locations. The company says its products will not only evolve to handle    <br />those kinds of jobs, but will also do them extraordinarily well. &quot;Over the next couple of releases,    <br />we'll see essentially fully autonomous databases,&quot; says Robert Shimp, vice president of database    <br />marketing.    <br />Oracle also wants to <font color="#0000ff">facilitate </font>collaboration for people in different companies with widely    <br />varying information types.&quot;What doesn't exist today is the underlying infrastructure, or plumbing,    <br />that's capable of managing all these <font color="#0000ff">diverse</font> types of data,&quot;Shimp says.&quot;What you need is the    <br />ability to link all these clustered databases around the globe into a single, unified view for the    <br />individual user.&quot;    <br />Elsewhere, researchers are finding that the best design for some database applications isn't a    <br />traditional database at all, but rather data streams. Researchers at Stanford University are working    <br />on ways that continuous flows of information—such as Web site hits, stock trades or    <br />telecommunications traffic—can be passed through queries and then archived or discarded. A    <br />query might, for example, be written to look continuously for suspicious patterns in network    <br />traffic and then spit out an alert.    <br />The problem in handling some kinds of problems with a traditional database management    <br />system is one of timeliness, says Jennifer Widom, a computer science professor at Stanford. &quot;If    <br />you want to put a stream of data into a DBMS, you have to at some point stop, create a load file,    <br />load the data and then query it,&quot;she says. &quot;Data stream queries are continuous; they just sit there    <br />and give you new answers automatically.&quot;</p>
<p>Widom and her colleagues are developing algorithms for stream queries, and she says her   <br />group will develop a comprehensive data stream management system. A prototype of such a    <br />system will take a number of years to develop, and the underlying technology will then be either    <br />licensed or offered as freeware, she says.</p>
