<p>Remember the promise of the paperless office? Computers communicating electronically with   <br />one another were going to replace the tons of paperwork that characterized business-to-business    <br />interaction: purchase orders, invoices, payments, confirmations, documentation. The list was nearly    <br />endless. Electronic document interchange (EDI) was going to be the savior or our systems and    <br />protector of our forests.    <br />It didn't happen. EDI never met the challenges of connecting scores of proprietary and    <br />mission-critical applications. Now a new success of is stepping up to the challenge.    <br />RosettaNet is both a set of standards and a global consortium of more than 500 electronic    <br />components, IT and semiconductor manufacturing companies working to create, implement and    <br />promote open e-business process standards. Founded in 1998, RisettaNet aims to align specific    <br />business processes among trading partners by defining and standardizing up to 100 e-business</p>
<p>transaction processes so that two companies' back-end systems can talk directly to each other.   <br />RosettaNet takes its name from the Rosetta stone, which a soldier in Napoleon's army    <br />discovered in Egypt in 1799. Since it contained parallel inscriptions in both Greek characters and    <br />Egyptian hieroglyphics, it provided a key to deciphering ancient Egyptian writing.    <br />This modern electronic translator speaks the contemporary languages of computer interoperability    <br />XML and SOAP    <br />which should allow disparate systems and business processes from different    <br />organizations to understand and exchange data with one another.    <br />The consortium began its Herculean task by looking at supply chain processes. Members used    <br />business-process modeling to identify the elements of a working business process and create a    <br />clearly defined model of current trading partner interfaces. After extensively researching every level    <br />of the supply chain, as well as analyzing misalignments and inefficiencies, they developed a set of    <br />generic, standardized processes that could serve as the basis for real-world business-to-business    <br />alignment.    <br />These Partner Interface Processes (PIP) are specialized system-to-system, XML-based    <br />dialogues. Each PIP specification includes a business document and a detailed business process    <br />that includes interaction, data transmission, security and error-handling requirements.    <br />PIPs use two data dictionaries    <br />one for business properties and another for technical properties    <br />that help different companies define the same produce in exactly the same way. The Rosettanet    <br />Implementation Framework defines an exchange protocol, and the Message Guidelines instruct    <br />implementers on how to encode individual PIPs into specific packages.    <br />Such efforts at standardizing generic processes have been tried before and failed. RosettaNet,    <br />however, seems more carefully grounded in the real world, and its PIPs are tested by consortium    <br />members. After consortium partners have agreed through a voting process that a PIP meets    <br />industry needs, it is then published on the RosettaNet Web site and is available for anyone to use.</p>
