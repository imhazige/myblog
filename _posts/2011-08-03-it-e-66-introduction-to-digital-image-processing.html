<p>An image is digitized to convert it to a form that can be stored in a computer's memory or on</p>
<p>some form of storage media such as a hard disk or CD-ROM. This digitization procedure can be   <br />done by a scanner, or by a video camera connected to a <font color="#0000ff">frame grabber board</font> in a computer. Once an    <br />image has been digitized, it can be operated upon by various image processing operations.    <br />Image processing operations can be roughly divided into three major categories, Image    <br />Compression, Image Enhancement and Restoration, and Measurement Extraction[提取尺寸]. Image    <br />compression is familiar to most people. [1]It involves reducing the amount of memory needed to    <br />store a digital image.    <br />Image defects which could be caused by the digitization process or by faults in the imaging    <br />set-up (for example, bad lighting) can be corrected using Image Enhancement techniques. Once    <br />the image is in good condition, the Measurement Extraction operations can be used to obtain    <br />useful information from the image.    <br />Some examples of Image Enhancement and Measurement Extraction are given below. The    <br />examples shown all operate on 256 grey-scale images. This means that each pixel in the image is    <br />stored as a number between 0 to 255, where 0 represents a black pixel, 255 represents a white    <br />pixel and values in-between represent shades of grey. These operations can be extended to    <br />operate on colour images.    <br />The examples below represent only a few of the many techniques available for operating on    <br />images. Details about the inner workings of the operations have not been given.    <br />Image Enhancement and Restoration    <br />The image at the left of Figure 1 has been corrupted <a href="http://kazge.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb.png" width="244" height="140" /></a>    <br />by noise during the digitization process. The &quot;clean&quot;    <br />image at the right of Figure 1 was obtained by applying a    <br /><font color="#0000ff">median filter</font> [中值滤波器]to the image.    <br />An image with poor contrast, such as the one at    <br />the left of Figure 2, can be improved by adjusting the    <br />image histogram to produce the image shown at the    <br />right of Figure 2.</p>
<p>&#160;<a href="http://kazge.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb1.png" width="244" height="116" /></a>    <br />The image at the top left of Figure 3 has a <font color="#0000ff">corrugated</font> effect due to a fault in the acquisition    <br />process. This can be removed by doing a 2-dimensional Fast-Fourier Transform[快速傅里叶变换] on the image    <br />(top right of Figure 3), removing the bright spots (bottom left of Figure 3), and finally doing an    <br />inverse Fast Fourier Transform to return to the original image without the corrugated background    <br />&#160; (bottom right of Figure 3).</p>

<p>An image which has been captured in poor lighting conditions, and shows a continuous   <br />change in the background brightness across the image (top left of Figure 4) can be corrected    <br />using the following procedure. First remove the foreground objects by applying a 25 by 25    <br />greyscale <font color="#0000ff">dilation </font>operation (top right of Figure 4). Then <font color="#0000ff">subtract</font> the original image from the    <br />background image (bottom left of Figure 4). Finally invert the colors and improve the contrast by    <br />adjusting the image histogram (bottom right of Figure 4).</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates how one could go about extracting measurements from an   <br />image. The image at the top left of Figure 5 shows some objects. The aim is to extract information    <br />about the distribution of the sizes (visible areas) of the objects. The first step involves <font color="#0000ff">segmenting</font>    <br />the image to separate the objects of interest from the background. This usually involves    <br /><font color="#0000ff">thresholding</font> the image, which is done by setting the values of pixels above a certain threshold value    <br />to white, and all the others to black (top right of Figure 5). Because the objects touch, thresholding    <br />at a level which includes the full surface of all the objects does not show separate objects. This    <br />problem is solved by performing a <font color="#0000ff">watershed</font> separation on the image (lower left of Figure 5). The    <br />image at the lower right of Figure 5 shows the result of performing a logical AND of the two    <br />images at the left of Figure 5. This shows the effect that the watershed separation has on touching    <br />objects in the original image. Finally, some measurements can be extracted from the image.</p>
