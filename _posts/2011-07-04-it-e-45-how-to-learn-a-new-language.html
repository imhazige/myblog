<p>How do you learn a new language? The fastest way is when you are forced to do so. But if   <br />you're lucky enough to be learning by choice, you are probably doing it in your spare time and    <br />you won't do that unless you are enjoying yourself&#160; so choose an interesting project.    <br />Choosing what you are going to write in your new language is more important than    <br />choosing the language. Choose the language to suit the project or, better, choose both together.    <br />For example, if you want to write something that will look good then don't choose a language    <br />with no support for graphics.    <br />Learn a little about the language before you start and try and find a solution that will play to    <br />the language's new features. If you are using OOP for the first time, for example, try and think    <br />how your project can be split into objects. If you are looking at functional programming, maybe a    <br />numerical project would be a good start (I chose cryptography) (this suggestion does not imply    <br />that functional languages are only useful for numerical code, just that most textbooks seem to    <br />feature numerical examples in my limited experience making it easier to start in that    <br />direction).    <br />At the same time, be honest with yourself. Don't be too ambitious don't pick too difficult a    <br />project and (maybe) don't pick too <font color="#0000ff">exotic</font> a language. The second point is debatable. With any    <br />language you will learn something new: it doesn't have to be a huge intellectual leap into the    <br />unknown. You are going to be more productive in a language that has some familiar ideas, and    <br />you can lean on that part of the language to get going. On the other hand, if you enjoy new ideas,    <br />maybe you will be happier with something completely different.    <br />Support is also important. If you intend to post questions to Usenet, is there an appropriate    <br />newsgroup? Personally, I like booksÇthe best impetus for me is finding a good book on    <br />computing that uses a particular language in the examples.    <br />A note about asking for information on newsgroups: people seem to vary widely in how    <br />precisely they talk about languages. At one end of the spectrum there are people who tend to rely    <br />on a &quot;<font color="#0000ff">subconscious</font>&quot; (or at least &quot;sub-language&quot;) intuition and happily <font color="#0000ff">misuse terminology </font>to &quot;get    <br />the idea across&quot;. At the other end are people who are very precise. Both, no doubt, will give    <br />conflicting advice on how to learn and, sometimes, apparently conflicting answers to questions.    <br />You have to learn to recognise different styles and read them in the context of the poster.    <br />Finally, don't be afraid to change direction. I've stuck with a few languages much more than    <br />with others. Sometimes I have given up in <font color="#0000ff">frustration</font>. But even when you only play around a    <br />little, you learn something. My argument is not that you must stay with a language a long time    <br />to learn anything, but that the learning continues. Stay for a while and you'll learn something.    <br />Stay longer and you'll learn more. there's no magic moment when you know everything (which    <br />is what makes programming such a rewarding profession).</p>
