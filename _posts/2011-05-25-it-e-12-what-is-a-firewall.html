<p>The term &quot;firewall&quot; illustrates a system that protects a network and the machines on them   <br />from various types of attack. Firewalls are geared towards keeping the server up all the time and    <br />protecting the entire network.    <br />The primary goal of a firewall is to implement a desired security policy; controlling access    <br />in both directions through the firewall, and to protect the firewall itself from compromise. It    <br />wards off intrusionattempts, Trojans and other malicious attacks.    <br />They are meant for the home user in a networked environment. They aim to block simple    <br />attacks, unlike the enterprise level firewalls that the corporate world uses at the server or router end.    <br />There are many ways to implement a firewall, each with specific advantages and disadvantages.    <br />Nowadays organizations and professionals use Internet technology to establish their online    <br />presence and showcase their products and services globally. Their endeavor is to leverage digital    <br />technology to make their business work for them.    <br />All the organizations and professionals are shifting from Dialup to broadband and getting a    <br />fixed IP. It has led to an increase in security attacks, bugs in everyday working. This does not</p>
<p>mean that Dialup being anonymous dynamic link or the firewall of the ISP network make you   <br />pretty safe.    <br />Now if your machine was under attack, you must have wondered what went wrong making    <br />your system crash suddenly. It is not necessary for anyone to actually know about you or your IP    <br />address to gain access to your system.    <br />If your system is infected or prone to intrusions, then beyond the anonymity of your Dialup    <br />connection or a dynamic IP, your system can be hacked.    <br />Intrusion </p>
<p>There are many ways to gain unauthorized access to a system. Operating system   <br />vulnerabilities, cracked or guessed passwords are some of the more common. Once access is    <br />attained, the intruder can send email, tamper with data, or use the system privileges to attack    <br />another system.    <br />Information Theft and Tampering</p>
<p>Data theft and tampering do not always require that the   <br />system be compromised. There have been many bugs with FTP servers that allow attackers to    <br />download password files or upload Trojan horses.    <br />A Service Attacks </p>
<p>Any attack that keeps the intended user from being able to use the   <br />services provided by their servers is considered a denial of service attack. There are many types    <br />of denial of service attacks, and unfortunately are very difficult to defend against. &quot;Mail bombs&quot;    <br />are one example in which an attacker repeatedly sends large mail files in the attempt at filling the    <br />server's disk file system thus preventing legitimate mail from being received.    <br />Joyrider </p>
<p>Not all attacks on computer systems are malicious. Joyriders are just looking for   <br />fun. Your system may be broken into just because it was easy, or to use the machine as a    <br />platform to attack others. It may be difficult to detect intrusion on a system that is used for this    <br />purpose. If the log files are modified, and if everything appears to be working, you may never    <br />know.    <br />Vandals </p>
<p>A vandal is malicious. They break in to delete files or crash computer systems   <br />either because they don't like you, or because they enjoy destroying things. If a vandal breaks    <br />into your computer, you will know about it right away. Vandals may also steal secrets and target    <br />your privacy.</p>
<p>Spies </p>
<p>Spies are out to get secret information. It may be difficult to detect break-ins by   <br />spies since they will probably leave no trace if they get what they are looking for.    <br />A personal firewall, therefore, is one of the methods you can use to deny such intrusions.</p>
