<p>(1) I thought electronic data interchange (EDI) was an old technology, why am I still   <br />hearing about it? EDI refers to the electronic exchange of business information between two</p>
<p>companies using a specific and structured format. The concept has been around since the 1970s   <br />and has traditionally been used to automate buyer-seller transactions such as invoices and    <br />purchase orders. But as more processes within a company become automated, EDI has expended    <br />to areas such as inventory management and product distribution.    <br />(2) How does it work?    <br />EDI relies on standards, or common methods of defining classes of business data, which    <br />allow computers to recognize what data belongs to what department in a company. In the early    <br />days of EDI, many companies built in-house EDI standards, but as interest grew, industries    <br />started to agree on common standards, administered by standards organizations. These standards,    <br />which allow computers in different organizations to share information over privately built, closed    <br />networks known as value-added networks, led to the use of EDI for corporate purchasing.    <br />(3) What are the benefitsF    <br />Consider a very simple non-EDI-based purchase. A buyer decides he needs 365 hammers.    <br />He creates a purchase order, prints it out and pops it in the mail. When the supplier gets the order,    <br />she types it into her company's computer system. The inventory guy pulls the order and ships out    <br />the hammers. Next, the supplier prints out and mails an invoice. It's not hard to imagine that this    <br />process could take several days. EDI has the potential to cut massive amounts of time out of the    <br />process. Sending documents, such as purchase orders or invoices, electronically takes minutes,    <br />not days, and shipments can often go out the day the order comes in. Moreover, the electronic    <br />format does not need to be rekeyed upon arrival, which also eliminates the possibility of typos.    <br />And EDI reduces costs by cutting down on data input, routing and delivery.    <br />(4) What does all of this have to do with the INTERNET    <br />Building an EDI system has traditionally required a substantial investment in some    <br />heavy-duty computers and networking equipment for both parties. Sometimes a large buyer, such    <br />as Wal-mart, will require that all its suppliers be EDI-compliant. That puts a burden on smaller    <br />suppliers, forcing them to choose between a heavy technical investment and a loss of business.    <br />And EDI isn't instantaneous. Because it uses information that frequently resides in mainframes,    <br />the quality of information on an EDI network depends on how frequently the data is refreshed    <br />from the mainframe.    <br />And that's the promise of the Web, which offers much lower connectivity costs. That, added    <br />to the lower costs of PCs and simpler software, makes EDI over the Web a compelling    <br />proposition. Moreover, XML, an open standard for sharing data on the Web, is starting to appear    <br />as a method of coding EDI standards, which could provide technical clarity across industries.    <br /> E-business    <br />(1) That does e-business really mean    <br />The most basic definition of e-business is simply this: using the Internet to connect with    <br />customers, partners, and suppliers. But the term also implies the transformation of existing business    <br />processes to make them more efficient. To engage in e-business, companies need to be able to unlock</p>
<p>data in their back-end computer systems, so they can share information and conduct electronic   <br />transactions with customers, partners, and suppliers via the Internet. And for some companies,    <br />engaging in e-business means adopting new web-enabled business models-auctioning off surplus    <br />goods, selling products directly to consumers, or joining in online purchasing cooperatives with their    <br />competitors. Without a doubt, embarkingon an e-business effort requires as much thinking about    <br />business strategy as it does about technology.    <br />(2) How is e-business different from e-commerceF    <br />In some instances, the terms are used interchangeably, but to purists, e-commerce refers    <br />only to online transactions. The term e-business encompasses online transactions, but it also    <br />refers to online exchanges of information, such as a manufacturer letting its suppliers monitor    <br />production schedules via an extranet (a secure web site that can be accessed only by authorized    <br />parties), or a financial institution letting its customers review their banking, credit card, and    <br />mortgageaccounts via a single web interface. In this respect, e-business overlaps with the    <br />business-technology disciplines of customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain    <br />management (SCM).    <br />(3) Just how much electronic commerce is being conducted via the Net    <br />Despite all the hype, Internet-based e-commerce currently amounts to only a small fraction of    <br />the U.s. GDP. But experts predict e-commerce volumes will grow exponentially over the next few    <br />years, particularly in business-to-business e-commerce    <br />that is, transactions between businesses    <br />and their suppliers, partners, and business customers. Cambridge, Mass.-based market researcher    <br />Forrester Research Inc. predicts business-to-business e-commerce in the U.S. will grow from    <br />$406.2 billion in 2000 to $207 trillion in 2004. By contrast, Forrester predicts that    <br />business-to-consumer e-commerce in the U.S. will grow from $38.8 billion in 2000 to $184.5    <br />billion in 2004.    <br />(4) Who should be in charge of a company's e-business effort?    <br />In some companies, early web efforts were led by marketing or IT departments as special    <br />projects. But that is starting to change, as e-business becomes a higher priority for the business as    <br />a whole. A recent survey of large global corporations by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and The    <br />Conference Board found that nearly 50 percent of them have full-time units devoted to e-business.    <br />A survey of dotcoms and traditional companies by International Data Corp. (a Darwin sister    <br />company) found that roughly 50 percent of e-business efforts are headed by CEOs.    <br />(5) Have all companies jumped on the e-business bandwagon?    <br />Not yet. Pricewaterhouse Coopers and The Conference Board found that 70 percent of the    <br />global companies they surveyed derive less than 5 percent of their revenues from e-business.    <br />Several factors have kept some companies surveyed from rolling out e-business initiatives,    <br />including the following: potentially high and uncertain implementation costs; lack of demonstrated    <br />ROI within their industry; concern about tax, legal, and privacy issues related to e-business; and    <br />scant use of the internet among their customers.</p>
<p>What is ERP?</p>
<p>(1) I'm tired of pretending I know what ERP is   <br />An enterprise resource planning software, or ERP, doesn't live up to its acronym. Forget    <br />about planning    <br />it doesn't    <br />and forget about resource, a throwaway term. But remember the    <br />enterprise part. This is ERP's true ambition. It attempts to integrate all departments and functions    <br />across a company to create a single software program that runs off one database.    <br />That's tall order. Each of those departments, like finance or human resource, typically has its    <br />own computer system, each optimized for the particular department. Typically, when a customer    <br />places an order, the order begins a mostly paper-based journey from in-basket to in-basket around    <br />the company, often being keyed and rekeyed into different computer systems along the way. All    <br />that lounging around in in-baskets causes delays and lost orders, and all the keying into different    <br />computer systems invites errors. Meanwhile, no one truly knows the order status.    <br />(2) So what can ERP do    <br />ERP automates the tasks necessary to perform a business process    <br />such as order fulfillment,    <br />which involves taking and order from a customer, shipping it and billing for it. With ERP, when    <br />a customer service representative takes an order, he or she has all the necessary information    <br />the    <br />customer's credit rating and order history, the company's inventory levels and the shipping dock's    <br />trucking schedule. Everyone else in the company can view the same information and has access    <br />to the single database that holds the order. When one department finishes with the order, it is    <br />automatically routed via the ERP system to the nest department. To find out where the order is at    <br />any point, one need only log in to the system. With luck, the order process moves like a bolt of    <br />lightning through the organization.    <br />(3) Sounds too good to be true. What's the catch    <br />To do ERP right, your company needs to change the way it does business. And that kind of    <br />change doesn't come without pain. It's critical to figure out if your way of doing business will fit    <br />within a standard ERP package before signing the check. The move to ERP is a project of    <br />breathtaking scope, and the price tags on the front end are enough to make even the most placed    <br />CFO a little twitchy. In addition to budgeting for software costs, financial executives should plan    <br />to write checks to cover consulting, process rework, integration testing and a long list of other    <br />expenses before the benefits of ERP appear. Underestimating the price of teaching users their    <br />new job processes can lead to a rude shock, and so can failure to consider data warehouse    <br />integration requirements and the cost of extra software to duplicate the old report formats.    <br />Oversights in financial planning can send the costs of an ERP project spiraling out of control.    <br />The impact will be far greater than any other systems project you have undertaken.</p>
