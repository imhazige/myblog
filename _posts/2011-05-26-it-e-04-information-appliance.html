<p>An &quot;information appliance (IA)&quot; is any device that can process information, signals,   <br />graphics, animation, video and audio; and can exchange such information with another IA device.    <br />Typical devices could be smartphones, smartcard, PDAs, and so on. Digital cameras, ordinary    <br />cellular phones, set-top boxes, and LCD TVs are not information appliances unless they become    <br />capable of communications and information functions. Information appliances may overlap in    <br />definition or are sometimes referred to as smart devices, mobile devices, wireless devices,    <br />internet appliances, web appliances, handhelds, handheld devices or smart handheld devices.    <br />Early Appliances For a short while during the middle and late 1980s there were a few    <br />models of simple electronic typewriters fitted with screens and some form of memory storage.    <br />These devices had some of the attributes of an information appliance. One of these dedicated    <br />word processor machines, the Canon Cat was actually designed by Jef Raskin as the forerunner    <br />of the idea of the information appliance.    <br />Information appliances tend to be consumer devices that perform only a few targeted tasks    <br />and are controlled by a simple touchscreen interface or push buttons on the device's enclosure.    <br />Open Standard Protocols In an ideal world, any true information appliance would be able to communicate with any other information appliance using open standard protocols and    <br />technologies, regardless of the maker of the software or the hardware. The communications    <br />aspects and all user interface elements would be designed together so that a user could switch    <br />seamlessly from one information appliance to another.</p>
