<p>What's actually involved in programming the actual process of writing programs? Here's a   <br />quick overview of the process:    <br /> Write a program.    <br /> Compile the program.    <br /> Run the program.    <br /> Debug the program.    <br /> Repeat the whole process until the program is finished.    <br />Let's discuss those steps one by one.    <br />I have a small amount of bad news for you: you can't write programs in English. It would be</p>
<p>nice indeed to be able to type &quot;count the number of words in a sentence&quot; into your computer and   <br />have it actually understand, but that's not going to happen for a while (unless someone writes a    <br />program to make a computer do that, of course). Instead, you have to learn a programming    <br />language.    <br />Much of a programming language is indeed in English. Programming languages commonly    <br />use words like &quot;if&quot;, &quot;repeat&quot;, &quot;end&quot; and such. Also, they use the familiar mathematical operators    <br />like &quot;+&quot; and &quot;=&quot;. It's just a matter of learning the &quot;grammar&quot; of the language; how to say things    <br />properly.    <br />So, we said &quot;Write a program&quot;. This means: write the steps needed to perform the task,    <br />using the programming language you know. You'll do the typing in a programming environment    <br />(an application program which lets you write programs, which is an interesting thought in itself).    <br />A common programming environment is CodeWarrior, and another common one is InterDev, but    <br />you don't need to worry about those just yet. Some programming environments are free, and    <br />some you have to buy just like any other application program. Commercial (non-free)    <br />programming environments cost anything from $50 to $500+, and you'll almost always get a    <br />huge discount if you're a student or teacher of some kind.    <br />Incidentally, the stuff you type to create a program is usually called source code, or just code.    <br />Programmers also sometimes call programming coding. We think it sounds slightly cooler.    <br />In order to use a program, you usually have to compile it first. When you write a program    <br />(in a programming language, using a programming environment, as we mentioned a moment    <br />ago), it's not yet in a form that the computer can use. This isn't hard to understand, given that    <br />computers actually only understand lots of 1s and 0s in long streams. You can't very well write    <br />programs using only vast amounts of 1s and 0s, so you write it in a more easily-understood form    <br />(a programming language), then you convert it to a form that the computer can actually use. This    <br />conversion process is called compiling, or compilation. Not surprisingly, a program called a    <br />compiler does the compiling.    <br />It's worth mentioning that if your program has problems which the compiler can't deal with,    <br />it won't be able to compile your program.    <br />You'll be pleased to hear that your programming environment will include a suitable compiler    <br />(or maybe more than one compiler: each different programming language your programming    <br />environment allows you to use requires its own compiler). Compilers are just <font color="#0000ff">fancy</font> programs, so    <br />they too are written by programmers. Programmers who write compilers are a bit like gods; they    <br />make it possible for everyone else to program.    <br />Now that you've compiled the program into a form that the computer can use, you want to    <br />see if it works: you want to make the computer perform the steps that you specified. This is    <br />called running the program, or sometimes executing it. Just the same as how a car isn't of much</p>
<p>use if you don't drive it, a program isn't of much use if you don't run it. Your programming   <br />environment will allow you to run your program too.    <br />You've probably heard the term &quot;debug&quot; before (it's pronounced just as you might expect:    <br />&quot;dee-bug&quot;). It refers to fixing errors and problems with your program. As I'm sure you know, the    <br />term came about because the earliest computers were huge building-sized <font color="#0000ff">contraptions</font>, and    <br />actual real-life insects sometimes flew into the machinery and caused <font color="#0000ff">havoc</font> with the <font color="#0000ff">circuits</font> and    <br /><font color="#0000ff">valves</font>. Hence, those first computer engineers had to physically &quot;debug&quot; the computers they had    <br />to <font color="#0000ff">scrape</font> the <font color="#0000ff">toasted</font> remains of various kinds of flying insects out of the inner workings of their    <br />machines. The term became used to describe any kind of problem-solving process in relation to    <br />computers, and we use it today to refer purely to fixing errors in our code.    <br />You may also have heard the phrase &quot;it's not a bug, it's a feature&quot;. Programmers sometimes    <br />say this when someone points out a problem with their programs; they're saying that it's not a bug,    <br />but rather a deliberate design choice (which is almost always a lie). This is rather like    <br />accidentally <font color="#0000ff">spilling</font> coffee all over yourself <font color="#0000ff">whilst</font> simultaneously falling down some stairs, then    <br />getting up and saying &quot;I meant to do that&quot;.    <br />Once again, your programming environment will help you to debug your programs (indeed,    <br />you'll often find the picture of an insect shown in your programming environment to indicate    <br />debugging). You usually debug your program by stepping through it. This means just what it    <br />sounds like: you go through your program one step at a time, watching how things are going and    <br />what's happening. Sooner or later (usually later), you'll see what's going wrong, and <font color="#0000ff">slap</font> yourself    <br />upside the head at the <font color="#0000ff">ridiculously</font> obvious error you've made.    <br />And then you repeat the whole process until you're happy with the program. This is trickier    <br />than it might sound, since programmers are never happy with their programs. You see,    <br />programmers are perfectionists never satisfied until absolutely everything is complete and    <br />elegant and powerful and just <font color="#0000ff">gorgeous</font>. Programmers will commonly release a new version of    <br />their program every day for a couple of weeks after the initial release.    <br />As you can imagine, enjoying an intellectual challenge is an important <font color="#0000ff">trait</font> to have when    <br />you're going back to correct and enhance your code many times over. You'll actually find that you    <br />can't wait to get back into your program and fix the bugs, make improvements, and refine the    <br />existing code.    <br />And that's the basic process of programming. Note that most programming environments    <br />will make a lot of it much easier for you, by doing such things as:    <br /> Warning you about common errors    <br /> Taking you to the specific bit of code which is causing the compiler to puke    <br /> Letting you quickly look up documentation on the programming language you're using    <br /> Letting you just choose to run the program, and compiling it automatically first</p>
<p> Colouring parts of your code to make it easier to read (for example, making numbers a   <br />different colour from other text)    <br /> And many other things    <br />So, don't worry too much about the specifics of compiling then running then debugging or    <br />whatever. The purpose of this section was mostly to make you aware of the <font color="#0000ff">cyclical</font> nature of    <br />programming: you write code, test it, fix it, write more, test it, fix, and so on.</p>
