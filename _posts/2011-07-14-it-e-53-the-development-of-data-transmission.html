<p>In the traditional, manual working environment, information (in the form of texts, numbers,   <br />etc.) and medium (such as paper) were closely <font color="#0000ff">intertwined</font>. Long experiences in their usage and    <br />the application of anti-counterfeit technology have made traditional forms of information very    <br />difficult to alter. Similarly, it was also difficult to send <font color="#0000ff">bogus </font>information by an <font color="#0000ff">impersonator</font>.    <br />Even those who succeeded in doing so usually were discovered very easily. In today's world of    <br />information and technology, the Internet is rapidly changing many ways people do things.    <br />Similarly, it has also introduced many management problems. For man and information to    <br />interact, there is a need to establish a reliable information system working environment in which    <br />we <font color="#0000ff">grasp</font>, distribute, store and manage information. Such an environment must be able to provide    <br />ample protection against <font color="#0000ff">tampering</font>, stealing, delaying, transmission by <font color="#0000ff">fictitious</font> parties, denial    <br />of having faxed a document, illegal intrusion and the like. Only so can we build a strong    <br />foundation for an information society.    <br />Security in the process of transmission, data <font color="#0000ff">resemble</font> all the cash in a bank armored <font color="#0000ff">van</font>. It    <br />can be lost or robbed anytime. With the purpose of maintaining data transmission security on the    <br />Internet, most people use encryption technology. Data to be transmitted is first encrypted as a    <br />way to prevent <font color="#0000ff">snooping</font> or theft. The &quot;Public-Key Cryptographic System&quot; has the functions of a    <br />&quot;digital signature&quot; and requires no prior exchange of keys while offering the advantages of    <br />&quot;secret communication.&quot; To make this system work smoothly, it is first necessary to agree and    <br />certify beforehand as to who or which institution holds a certain key. This goes to say that a    <br />certification management system must first be established to handle issuance or <font color="#0000ff">revocation</font> of    <br />electronic certification. In addition to this system, all matters related to its usage and application    <br />services must form part of the basic operations framework of the whole system.</p>
<p>The first important thing in maintaining data security is the periodic making of back-ups.   <br />Personal computer users must periodically make back-ups of data using different back-up tools    <br />(such as diskettes, magnetic tape, removable hard drives, etc.) and store them in a safe location. If    <br />and when data from a personal computer is damaged and cannot be recovered, the back-up copies    <br />will serve their purpose. Thus, the first step in data security is to develop the habit of making    <br />periodic back-ups. It is the most effective way to assure data security under extreme circumstances.    <br />There are many factors that pose a threat to data security. They include viruses, deliberate acts of    <br />sabotage and theft. Users can guard against them using the following methods: Use a protection    <br />password for access to personal computers and the Internet. This prevents the unauthorized from    <br />stealing or damaging data inside personal computers. Handle files with encryption protection and    <br /><font color="#0000ff">decipher</font> only when necessary. In this way, even if files are stolen, encryption would still be    <br />necessary to use the files. Files transmitted through the Internet must first be encrypted. The    <br />Internet is an open environment where anybody can intercept data during transmission. Encryption    <br />of such data is an effective way to prevent unwanted disclosure. Respect intellectual property rights    <br />by refraining from using software programs of dubious sources. This way, viral attack can be    <br />avoided or the use of Trojan Horse by the <font color="#0000ff">unscrupulous</font> to steal data can be <font color="#0000ff">thwarted</font>.    <br />Passwords and names of users of databases and application programs must be kept    <br />confidential. Avoid using birth dates, telephone numbers and other readily accessible figures as    <br />passwords. They must be handled carefully and recorded in secret locations. Periodic changing of    <br />passwords is also recommended. Print-outs of application software programs no longer used must    <br />be shredded to prevent disclosure of data. Build up a no-diskette system environment to avoid    <br />computer virus contamination.    <br />To guarantee data security, the Information Department must, in addition to setting up    <br />comprehensive regulations, ensure cooperation by users. Their usage of computer equipment    <br />according to regulated procedures contributes to the effective maintenance of data security.    <br />It is necessary to build up a data security audit system that includes periodic and random    <br />spot checks and testing of information security and protection operations, as well as <font color="#0000ff">conduct</font>    <br />tracking and improvement of deficiencies.</p>
