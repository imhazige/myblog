<p>Any one responsible for the security of a trusted network will be concerned when connecting   <br />it to a distrusted network. In the case of connections to the Internet this concern may be based    <br />largely on <font color="#0000ff">anecdotal </font>evidence <font color="#0000ff">gleaned</font> from widespread media coverage of security <font color="#0000ff">breaches</font>. A    <br />closer inspection of the facts and statistics behind some of the media coverage will, however, only    <br />serve to deepen that concern. For example, the US National Computer Security Agency (NCSA)    <br />asserts that most attacks to computer systems go undetected and unreported, <font color="#0000ff">citing</font> attacks made    <br />against 9,000 Department of Defence computers by the US Defence Information Systems Agency</p>
<p>(DISA). These attacks had an 88 percent success rate and went undetected by more than 95 percent   <br />of the target organizations. Only 5 percent of the 5 percent that detected an attack, a mere 22 sites,    <br />reacted to it.    <br />It is noteworthy that these sites belong to the US Department of Defence (DoD) and were    <br />not commercial sites, which may give security less priority than the DoD.    <br />NCSA also quote the FBI as reporting that in more than 80 percent of FBI investigated    <br />computer crimes, unauthorized access was gained through the Internet.    <br />Putting a value on the damage done by such attacks is difficult but a 1995 survey conducted    <br />by Ernst &amp; Young, a New York based accounting firm, reported that one third of businesses    <br />connected to the Internet reported up to 100 000 USD in financial loss over a two year period due    <br />to malicious acts by computer users outside the firm. A little more than two percent of connected    <br />companies reported losses of more than 1M USD.    <br />There is amazement in the computer security industry at the level of ignorance to the    <br />problem. To understand the risks often involves a steep learning curve and they have few real    <br />parallels in everyday life, for example nobody worries that a <font color="#0000ff">burglar </font>will be able to trick their    <br />front door into opening by posting <font color="#0000ff">cryptic</font> messages through the letterbox. When there is a good    <br />&quot;hacker&quot; story to report the press goes into frenzy, but the general level of awareness is still    <br />surprisingly low. For example, the Sunday Times which prides itself on providing accurate    <br />coverage of IT issues published an article recently that claimed that most businesses worry too    <br />much about Internet security. The article goes on to explain that encryption is all that is needed to    <br />be completely secure. The article focuses purely on privacy of communication and completely    <br />misses the possibility of an attack originating from the Internet.</p>
