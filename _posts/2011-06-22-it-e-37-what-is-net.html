<p>.NET is both a business strategy from Microsoft and its collection of programming support   <br />for what are known as Web services, the ability to use the Web rather than your own computer for    <br />various services. Microsoft's goal is to provide individual and business users with a seamlessly    <br /><font color="#0000ff">interoperable</font> and Web-enabled interface for applications and computing devices and to make    <br />computing activities increasingly Web browser-oriented. The .NET platform includes servers;    <br />building-block services, such as Web-based data storage; and device software. It also includes    <br />Passport, Microsoft's fill-in-the-form-only-once identity verification service.    <br />The .NET platform is expected to provide:    <br /> The ability to make the entire range of computing devices work together and to have user    <br />information automatically updated and synchronized on all of them.    <br /> Increased interactive capability for Web sites, enabled by greater use of XML (Extensible    <br />Markup Language) rather than HTML.    <br /> A premium online subscription service, that will feature customized access and delivery of    <br />products and services to the user from a central starting point for the management of various    <br />applications, such as e-mail, for example, or software, such as Office .NET.    <br /> Centralized data storage, which will increase efficiency and ease of access to information, as    <br />well as synchronization of information among users and devices.    <br /> The ability to integrate various communications media, such as e-mail, faxes, and    <br />telephones.    <br /> For developers, the ability to create reusable modules, which should increase productivity    <br />and reduce the number of programming errors.    <br />According to Bill Gates, Microsoft expects that .NET will have as significant an effect on    <br />the computing world as the introduction of Windows. One concern being voiced is that    <br />although .NET's services will be accessible through any browser, they are likely to function more    <br />fully on products designed to work with .NET code.</p>
<p>The full release of .NET is expected to take several years to complete, with <font color="#0000ff">intermittent</font>    <br />releases of products such as a personal security service and new versions of Windows and Office    <br />that implement the .NET strategy coming on the market separately. Visual Studio .NET is a    <br />development environment that is now available. Windows XP supports certain .NET capabilities.</p>
