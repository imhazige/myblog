<p>In recent years, Internet changes our life a lot. We use e-mail and Internet phone to talk with   <br />our friends, we get up-to-date information through web and we do shopping in the cyber-market.    <br />Internet has many advantages over traditional communication channels, e.g. it's cost effective, it    <br />delivers information fast and it is not restricted by time and place. [1]The more people use Internet,    <br />the more concerns about Internet security.    <br />In person-to-person community, security is based on physical <font color="#0000ff">cues</font>. To name but a few, we    <br />use our signature to authenticate ourselves; we seal letters to prevent others inspection and    <br />modification; we receive receipt with the shop's <font color="#0000ff">chop </font>to make sure we paid; we get information    <br />from a reliable source. But in the Internet society, no such physical cue is available. There are    <br />two areas that we concern about in Internet communication. The first one is <font color="#0000ff">secrecy</font>how do we    <br />ensure no one reads the data during its transmission? The second one is authenticationhow do    <br />we be sure that the identity of someone claiming &quot;who it is&quot;. Imagine one day you receive an</p>
<p>e-mail, which the e-mail sender is &quot;Bill Gates&quot;. How do you confirm the e-mail is actually sent   <br />by Bill Gates?    <br />Encryption is the way to solve the data security problem. In real life, if Tom wants to talk with    <br />Mary secretly, he can choose a room with nobody there and talk with Mary quietly, or he can talk    <br />with Mary using codes understandable by Tom and Mary only. We take the second approach    <br />encryptionto transmit data through Internet. There are two kinds of encryption techniques    <br /><font color="#0000ff">symmetric</font> key encryption and <font color="#0000ff">asymmetric</font> key encryption.    <br />For symmetric key encryption, both parties should have a <font color="#0000ff">consensus</font> about a secret encryption key.    <br />When A wants to send a message to B, A uses the secret key to encrypt the message. After receiving the    <br />encrypted message ,B uses the same (or derived)secret key to encrypt the message.The advantage of    <br />using symmetric key encryption lies in its fast encryption and decryption processes(when compared    <br />with asymmetric key encryption at the same security level). The disadvantages are , first, the encryption    <br />key must be exchanged between two parties in a secure way before sending secret messages. Secondly,    <br />we must use different keys with different parties. For example, if A communicates with B, C, D and E,    <br />A should use 4 different keys. Otherwise, B will know what A and C as well as A and D has been    <br />talking about. The drawbacks of symmetric key encryption make it unsuitable to be used in the Internet,    <br />because it's difficult to find a secure way to exchange the encryption key.    <br />For asymmetric key encryption, there is a pair of keys for each party: a public key and a    <br />private key. The public key is freely available to the public, but only the key owner gets hold of    <br />the private key. Messages encrypted by a public key can only be decrypted by its corresponding    <br />private key, and vice versa. When A sends message to B, A first gets B's public key to encrypt    <br />the message and sends it to A. After receiving the message, B uses his private key to decrypt the    <br />message. The advantage comes in the public key freely available to the public, hence free from    <br />any key exchange problem. The disadvantage is the slow encryption and decryption process.    <br />[2]Almost all encryption schemes used in the Internet uses asymmetric key encryption for    <br />exchanging the symmetric encryption key, and symmetric encryption for better performance.    <br />Asymmetric key <font color="#0000ff">cryptography</font> seems to attain secrecy in data transmission, but the authentication    <br />problem still exists. Consider the following scenario: when A sends a message to B, A gets B's    <br />public key from the Internetbut how can A know the public key obtained actually belongs to B?    <br />Digital certificate emerges to solve this problem.    <br />Digital certificate is an identity card counterpart in the computer society. When a person    <br />wants to get a digital certificate, he generates his own key pair, gives the public key as well as    <br />some proof of his identification to the Certificate Authority (CA). CA will check the person's    <br />identification to assure the identity of the applicant.[3] If the applicant is really the one &quot;who    <br />claims to be&quot;, CA will issue a digital certificate, with the applicant's name, e-mail address and the    <br />applicant's public key, which is also signed digitally with the CA's private key. When A wants to    <br />send B a message, instead of getting B's public key, A now has to get B's digital certificate. A    <br />first checks the certificate authority's signature with the CA's public key to make sure it's a    <br />trustworthy certificate. Then A obtain B's public key from the certificate, and uses it to encrypt</p>
<p>message and sends to B.   <br />Authentication is an important part everyday life. The lack of strong authentication has    <br />inhibited the development of electronic commerce. It is still necessary for contracts, legal    <br />documents and official letters to be produced on paper. Strong authentication is then, a key    <br />requirement if the Internet is to be used for electronic commerce. Strong authentication is    <br />generally based on modern equivalents of the one time pad. For example tokens are used in place    <br />of one-time pads and are stored on smart cards or disks.    <br />[4] Many people pay great amounts of lip service to security, but do not want to be bothered    <br />with it when it gets in their way. It's important to build systems and networks in such a way that    <br />the user is not constantly reminded of the security system around him. Users who find security    <br />policies and systems too restrictive will find ways around them. Security is everybody's business,    <br />and only with everyone's cooperation, an intelligent policy, and consistent practices, will it be    <br />achievable.</p>
