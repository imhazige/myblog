<p>Network architecture describes how computer network is arranged and how computer   <br />resources are shared.    <br />There are a number of specialized terms that describes computer network. Some terms often    <br />used with networks are: node, client, server, network operating system, distributed processing    <br />and host computer.    <br />A node is any device that is connected to a network. It could be a computer, printer, or    <br />communication or data storage device.    <br />A client is a node that requests and uses resources available from other nodes. Typically, a</p>
<p>client is a user's microcomputer.   <br />A server is a node that shares resources with other nodes. Depending on the resources    <br />shared, it may be called a file server, printer server, communication server, or database server.    <br />Network operating system likes Windows, it controls and coordinate the activities between    <br />computers on a network. These activities include electronic communication, information, and    <br />resource sharing.    <br />In a distributed processing system, computing power is located and shared at different    <br />locations. [1]This type of system is common in decentralized organizations where divisional    <br />offices have their own computer systems. The computer systems in the divisional offices are    <br />networked to the organization's main or centralized computer.    <br />Host computer is a large centralized computer, usually a minicomputer or a mainframe.    <br />A network may consist only of microcomputers, or it may integrate microcomputers or    <br />other devices with large computers. [2]Networks can be controlled by all nodes working together    <br />equally or by specialized nodes coordinating and supplying all resources. Networks may be    <br />simple or complex, self-contained or dispersed over a large geographical area.    <br />Configuration A network can be arranged or configured in several different ways. The    <br />four principal configurations are star, bus, ring, and hierarchical.    <br />In a star network, a number of small computers or peripheral devices are linked to a central    <br />unit. This central unit may be a host computer or a file server. All communications pass through    <br />this central unit. Control is maintained by polling. That is, each connecting device is asked    <br />whether it has a message to send. Each device is then in turn allowed to send its message. One    <br />particular advantage of the star form of network is that it can be used to provide a time-sharing    <br />system. That is, several users can share resources (&quot;time&quot;) on a central computer. The star is a    <br />common arrangement for linking several microcomputers to a mainframe that allows access to an    <br />organization’s database.    <br />In a bus network, each device in the network handles its own communications control. There    <br />is no host computer. All communications travel along a common connecting cable called a bus. As    <br />the information passes along the bus, it's examined by each device to see if the information is    <br />intended for it. The bus network is typically used when only a few microcomputers are to be linked    <br />together. This arrangement is common in systems for electronic mail or for sharing data stored on    <br />different microcomputers. The bus network is not as efficient as the star network for sharing    <br />common resources. (This is because the bus network is not a direct link to the resource.) However,    <br />a bus network is less expensive and is in very common use.    <br />In a ring network, each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. There is no    <br />central file server or computer. Message are passed around the ring until they reach the correct    <br />destination. With microcomputers, the ring arrangement is the least frequently used of the four    <br />networks. However, it often is used to link mainframes, especially over wide geographical areas.    <br />These mainframes tend to operate fairly autonomously. They perform most or all of their own    <br />processing and only occasionally share data and programs with other mainframes. A ring</p>
<p>network is useful in a decentralized organization because it makes possible a distributed data   <br />processing system. That is, computers can perform processing tasks at their own dispersed    <br />locations. However, they can also share programs, data and other resources with each other.    <br />The hierarchical network consists of several computers linked to a central host computer,    <br />just like a star network. However, these other computers are also hosts to other, smaller    <br />computers or to peripheral devices. Thus, the host at the top of the hierarchy could be a    <br />mainframe. The computers below the mainframe could be minicomputers, and those below,    <br />microcomputers. The hierarchical network—also called a hybrid network—allows various    <br />computers to share databases, processing power, and different output devices. A hierarchical    <br />network is useful in centralized organizations. For example, different departments within an    <br />organization may have individual microcomputers connected to departmental minicomputers.    <br />The minicomputers in turn may be connected to the corporation’s mainframe, which contains    <br />data and programs accessible to all.    <br />Strategies </p>
<p>Every network has a strategy or way of coordinating the sharing of information   <br />and resources. The most common network strategies are peer-to-peer and client/server systems.    <br />In a peer-to-peer network system nodes can act as both servers and clients. For example, one    <br />microcomputer can obtain files located on another microcomputer and can also provide files to    <br />other microcomputers. A typical configuration for a peer-to-peer system is the bus network.    <br />Commonly used net operating systems are Apple's Macintosh Peer-to-Peer LANs, Novell’s    <br />Netware Lite, and Microsoft's Windows for Workgroups. There are several advantages to using this    <br />type of strategy. The networks are inexpensive and easy to install, and they usually work well for    <br />smaller systems with less than ten nodes. As the number of nodes increases, however, the    <br />performance of the network declines. Another disadvantage is the lack of powerful management    <br />software to effectively monitor a large network's activities. For these reasons, peer-to-peer network    <br />are typically used by small networks.    <br />Client/server network systems use one powerful computer to coordinate and supply services to    <br />all other nodes on the network. This strategy is based on specialization. Server nodes coordinate    <br />and supply specialized services, and client nodes request the services. Commonly used net    <br />operating systems are Novell's Netware, Microsoft's LAN and Windows NT. One advantage of    <br />client/server network systems is their ability to handle very large networks efficiently. Another    <br />advantage is the powerful network management software that monitors and controls the network's    <br />activities. The major disadvantages are the cost of installation and maintenance.</p>
