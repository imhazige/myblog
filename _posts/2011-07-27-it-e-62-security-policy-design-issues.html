<p>When designing a firewall system and its corresponding security policy, a number of   <br />questions should be answered. The first question involves the company's expected level of    <br />security. Is the company trying to restrict all access to services not <font color="#0000ff">deemed</font> essential to the    <br />business? Or does the company wish to allow all or most types of transactions, thus asking the    <br />firewall system only to audit transactions and create an orderly request for transactions?    <br />Restricting all access to services not deemed essential requires a more elaborate firewall system    <br />and thus more work and expense. Allowing most types of transactions requires a simpler system    <br />that only performs queue management operations and creates an audit trail.    <br />A second question <font color="#0000ff">stems</font> from the first decision: How much money is the company willing    <br />to invest in a firewall system? Commercially-purchased firewall systems can be powerful,    <br />complex, and expensive. It is possible, however, to construct a home-grown firewall system that    <br />takes advantage of the capabilities of existing equipment, such as routers and network operating    <br />systems. As we saw earlier, it is possible to restrict access into a system based on time of day,    <br />day of week, and location. It is also possible to use existing software to create an audit trail of all    <br />incoming and outgoing transactions. Depending on the detail of auditing required, additional    <br />software can be purchased and installed that will work in concert with network operating system    <br />software to provide any desired level of audits.    <br />Similarly, many routers can be programmed to restrict access to certain kinds of traffic. A router    <br />can be programmed to accept and reject requests with specific IP addresses or a range of IP addresses.    <br />Routers can also be programmed to deny access to certain port addresses at the TCP level.    <br />A third question relates to the company's commitment to security. If the company is serious    <br />about restricting access to the corporate network through a link such as the Internet, will the</p>
<p>company be equally serious about supporting security on any and all other links into the   <br />corporate network environment? Dial-up modem access, wireless network access, and other    <br />telecommunication links should also be considered when making security decisions. Fax    <br />machines, both stand alone and computer based, as well as removable disk media are two more    <br />examples of how data may enter or leave a corporation. Any security policy must take these    <br />entrance and exit points, as well as the Internet, into consideration.    <br />Having a well-designed security policy in place will make the jobs of network support staff    <br />clearer. The staff employees will know what the network users can and cannot access and where    <br />they can and cannot go. A well-designed security policy will make enforcement more    <br />straightforward, and it will allow the staff to react properly to specific security requests. The    <br />policy will also make clear the goals and duties of network employees in enforcing security with    <br />respect to requests from the outside. If there is a good security policy, the users themselves will    <br />have a better understanding of what they can and cannot do. This understanding will hopefully    <br />assist the network staff in conducting their jobs and will allow the company to maintain security    <br />in an increasingly insecure world.    <br />Perhaps because companies have well-designed security policies in place, many people who    <br />use the Internet to purchase items online are growing comfortable with the fact that, if they    <br />transfer credit card information during a secure session, their data is safe from hackers and other    <br />eavesdroppers. This sense of security may change, however, because the Internet Engineering    <br />Task Force is considering whether to allow a backdoor entry into all Internet traffic. This    <br />backdoor entry would allow authorized persons to intercept any data traffic on the Internet. Since    <br />this proposal appears to be a violation of privacy, why would anyone want to create such a    <br />backdoor?    <br />At the core of the argument is the fact that standard telephone systems currently allow    <br />agencies of the U.S. government to <font color="#0000ff">wiretap</font> communications. This wiretap occurs at the    <br />telephone central office and is built into central office telephone switches.    <br />The act that allows wiretapping (the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act)    <br />has been in existence since 1994. Now that the Internet is beginning to carry voice traffic, should    <br />it also be possible for the U.S. government to wiretap voice transactions on the Internet? As one    <br />critic of the proposal states, if they can tap voice, then they can tap data. Furthermore, if the    <br />designers of the Internet create such a backdoor, it is also possible that this knowledge could fall    <br />into the wrong hands and be used for criminal intent.    <br />This issue is further complicated by the fact that many businesses presently encrypt all data    <br />leaving the corporate network. Most encryption techniques used by businesses are so effective    <br />that virtually no one, including the government, can crack them. If the network does the    <br />encryption just before the data leaves corporate boundaries, then it would be the responsibility of    <br />the corporate network support personnel to provide the U.S. government, if asked, with    <br />unencrypted data. If, on the other hand, the encryption is applied at the user workstation before it    <br />is inserted onto the corporate network, who will supply the U.S. government with the</p>
<p>unencrypted data? Clearly, this issue will be hotly debated for some time to come.   <br />Despite the fact that a company may have a well-designed security policy in place, external    <br />events are making this area more complex all the time.</p>
