<p>The relational model is the basis for any relational database management system (RDBMS).    <br />[1]A relational model has three core components: a collection of objects or relations, operators     <br />that act on the objects or relations, and data integrity methods. In other words, it has a place to     <br />store the data, a way to create and retrieve the data, and a way to make sure that the data is     <br />logically consistent.     <br />A relational database uses relations, or two-dimensional tables, to store the information     <br />needed to support a business. Let's go over the basic components of a traditional relational     <br />database system and look at how a relational database is designed. Once you have a solid     <br />understanding of what rows, columns, tables, and relationships are, you'll be well on your way to     <br /><font color="#0000ff">leveraging</font> the power of a relational database.     </p>
<p>A table in a relational database, alternatively known as a relation, is a two-dimensional     <br />structure used to hold related information. A database consists of one or more related tables.     <br />NoteDon't confuse a relation with relationships. A relation is <font color="#0000ff">essentially </font>a table, and a     <br />relationship is a way to <font color="#0000ff">correlate</font>, join, or associate two tables.     <br />A row in a table is a collection or instance of one thing, such as one employee or one line     <br />item on an invoice. [2]A column contains all the information of a single type, and the piece of data     <br />at the <font color="#0000ff">intersection </font>of a row and a column, a field, is the smallest piece of information that can be     <br />retrieved with the database's query language. For example, a table with information about     <br />employees might have a column called LAST_NAME that contains all of the employees' last     <br />names. Data is retrieved from a table by filtering on both the row and the column.     </p>
<p>The examples throughout this article will focus on the <font color="#0000ff">hypothetical </font>work of Scott Smith,     <br />database developer and <font color="#0000ff">entrepreneur</font>. He just started a new widget company and wants to     <br />implement a few of the basic business functions using the relational database to manage his</p>
<p>Human Resources (HR) department.    <br />Relation</p>
<p>A two-dimensional structure used to hold related information, also known as a    <br />table.     <br />Note</p>
<p>Most of Scott's employees were hired away from one of his previous employers, some    <br />of whom have over 20 years of experience in the field. As a hiring <font color="#0000ff">incentive</font>, Scott has agreed to     <br />keep the new employees' original hire date in the new database.     <br />Row</p>
<p>A group of one or more data elements in a database table that describes a person,    <br />place, or thing.     <br />Column</p>
<p>The component of a database table that contains all of the data of the same name    <br />and type across all rows.     <br />You'll learn about database design in the following sections, but let's assume for the moment     <br />that the majority of the database design is completed and some tables need to be implemented.     <br />Scott creates the EMP table to hold the basic employee information, and it looks something like     <br />this:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>EMPNO ENAME JOB MGR HIREDATE SAL COMM DEPTNO    <br />7369 SMITH CLERK 7902 17-DEC-80 800 20     <br />7499 ALLEN SALESMAN 7698 20-FEB-81 1600 300 30     <br />7521 WARD SALESMAN 7698 22-FEB-81 1250 500 30     <br />7566 JONES MANAGER 7839 02-APR-81 2975 20     <br />7839 KING PRESIDENT 17-NOV-81 5000 10     <br />7902 FORD ANALYST 7566 03-DEC-81 3000 20</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Notice that some fields in the Commission (COMM) and Manager (MGR) columns do not    <br />contain a value; they are blank. A relational database can enforce the rule that fields in a column     <br />may or may not be empty. [3]In this case, it makes sense for an employee who is not in the Sales     <br />department to have a blank Commission field. It also makes sense for the president of the     <br />company to have a blank Manager field, since that employee doesn't report to anyone. </p>
<p>Field</p>
<p>The smallest piece of information that can be retrieved by the database query    <br />language. A field is found at the intersection of a row and a column in a database table.     <br />On the other hand, none of the fields in the Employee Number (EMPNO) column are blank.     <br />The company always wants to assign an employee number to an employee, and that number must     <br />be different for each employee. One of the features of a relational database is that it can ensure     <br />that a value is entered into this column and that it is unique. The EMPNO column, in this case, is     <br />the primary key of the table.     <br />Primary Key</p>
<p>A column (or columns) in a table that makes the row in the table    <br />distinguishable from every other row in the same table.     <br />Notice the different datatypes that are stored in the EMP table: numeric values, character or</p>
<p>alphabetic values, and date values.    <br />As you might suspect, the DEPTNO column contains the department number for the     <br />employee. But how do you know what department name is associated with what number?     <br />Scott created the DEPT table to hold the descriptions for the department codes in the EMP     <br />table.     <br />The DEPTNO column in the EMP table contains the same values as the DEPTNO column     <br />in the DEPT table. In this case, the DEPTNO column in the EMP table is considered a foreign     <br />key to the same column in the DEPT table.     <br />A foreign key enforces the concept of referential <font color="#0000ff">integrity</font> in a relational database. [4]The     <br />concept of referential integrity not only prevents an invalid department number from being     <br />inserted into the EMP table, but it also prevents a row in the DEPT table from being deleted if     <br />there are employees still assigned to that department.     <br />Foreign Key</p>
<p>A column (or columns) in a table that draws its values from a primary or    <br />unique key column in another table. A foreign key assists in ensuring the data integrity of a table.     <br />Referential Integrity</p>
<p>A method employed by a relational database system that enforces    <br />one-to-many relationships between tables.     </p>
<p>Before Scott created the actual tables in the database, he went through a design process known     <br />as data modeling. In this process, the developer conceptualizes and documents all the tables for the     <br />database. One of the common methods for modeling a database is called ERA, which stands for     <br />entities, relationships, and attributes. The database designer uses an application that can maintain     <br />entities, their attributes, and their relationships. In general, an entity corresponds to a table in the     <br />database, and the attributes of the entity correspond to columns of the table.     <br />Data ModelingA process of defining the entities, attributes, and relationships between the     <br />entities in preparation for creating the physical database.     <br />The data-modeling process involves defining the entities, defining the relationships between     <br />those entities, and then defining the attributes for each of the entities. Once a cycle is complete, it     <br />is repeated as many times as necessary to ensure that the designer is capturing what is important     <br />enough to go into the database. Let's take a closer look at each step in the data-modeling process.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>First, the designer identifies all of the entities within the scope of the database application.    <br />The entities are the persons, places, or things that are important to the organization and need to be     <br />tracked in the database. Entities will most likely translate neatly to database tables. For example,     <br />for the first version of Scott's widget company database, he identifies four entities: employees,     <br />departments, salary grades, and bonuses. These will become the EMP, DEPT, SALGRADE, and     <br />BONUS tables.     </p>
<p>Once the entities are defined, the designer can proceed with defining how each of the    <br />entities is related. Often, the designer will pair each entity with every other entity and ask, &quot;Is     <br />there a relationship between these two entities?&quot; Some relationships are obvious; some are not.     <br />In the widget company database, there is most likely a relationship between EMP and DEPT,     <br />but depending on the business rules, it is unlikely that the DEPT and SALGRADE entities are     <br />related. If the business rules were to restrict certain salary grades to certain departments, there     <br />would most likely be a new entity that defines the relationship between salary grades and     <br />departments. This entity would be known as an <font color="#0000ff">associative </font>or intersection table and would     <br />contain the valid combinations of salary grades and departments.     <br />Associative Table</p>
<p>A database table that stores the valid combinations of rows from two    <br />other tables and usually enforces a business rule. An associative table resolves a many-to-many     <br />relationship.     <br />In general, there are three types of relationships in a relational database:     <br />One-to-many </p>
<p>The most common type of relationship is one-to-many. This means that    <br />for each occurrence in a given entity, the parent entity, there may be one or more     <br />occurrences in a second entity, the child entity, to which it is related. For example, in the     <br />widget company database, the DEPT entity is a parent entity, and for each department,     <br />there could be one or more employees associated with that department. The relationship     <br />between DEPT and EMP is one-to-many.     <br />One-to-one </p>
<p>In a one-to-one relationship, a row in a table is related to only one or none    <br />of the rows in a second table. This relationship type is often used for subtyping. For     <br />example, an EMPLOYEE table may hold the information common to all employees,     <br />while the FULLTIME, PARTTIME, and CONTRACTOR tables hold information unique     <br />to full-time employees, part-time employees, and contractors, respectively. These entities     <br />would be considered subtypes of an EMPLOYEE and maintain a one-to-one relationship     <br />with the EMPLOYEE table. These relationships are not as common as one-to-many     <br />relationships, because if one entity has an occurrence for a corresponding row in another     <br />entity, in most cases, the attributes from both entities should be in a single entity.     <br />Many-to-many </p>
<p>In a many-to-many relationship, one row of a table may be related to    <br />many rows of another table, and vice versa. Usually, when this relationship is</p>
<p>implemented in the database, a third entity is defined as an intersection table to contain    <br />the associations between the two entities in the relationship. For example, in a database     <br />used for school class enrollment, the STUDENT table has a many-to-many relationship     <br />with the CLASS table—one student may take one or more classes, and a given class may     <br />have one or more students. The intersection table STUDENT_CLASS would contain the     <br />combinations of STUDENT and CLASS to track which students are in which classes.     </p>
<p>Once the designer has defined the entity relationships, the next step is to assign the attributes     <br />to each entity. This is physically implemented using columns, as shown here for the SALGRADE     <br />table as derived from the salary grade entity.     </p>
<p>After the entities, relationships, and attributes have been defined,     <br />the designer may iterate the data modeling many more times. When     <br />reviewing relationships, new entities may be discovered. For example,     <br />when discussing the widget inventory table and its relationship to a     <br />customer order, the need for a shipping restrictions table may arise.     <br />Once the design process is complete, the physical database     <br />tables may be created. [5]Logical database design sessions should not     <br />involve physical implementation issues, but once the design has gone through an iteration or two,     <br />it's the DBA's job to bring the designers &quot;down to earth.&quot; As a result, the design may need to be     <br />revisited to balance the ideal database implementation versus the realities of budgets and schedules.</p>
