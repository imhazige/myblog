<p>To get here to there, data must move through something. A telephone line, cable, or the   <br />atmosphereare all transmission media, or channels. But before the data can be communicated, it    <br />must be converted into a form suitable for communication.    <br />Data communications lines can be connected in two types of configurations: point-to-point    <br />and multidrop. A point-to-point line directly connects the sending and the receiving devices, and    <br />a multidrop line connects many devices, not just one sending device and one receiving device.    <br />The two ways of connecting microcomputers with each other and with other equipments are    <br />through the cable and through the air. There are three basic forms into which data can be    <br />converted for communication: electrical pulses or charges, electromagnetic waves, and pulses of    <br />light.    <br />Specifically, five kinds of technology are used to transmit data. These are telephone lines    <br />(twisted pair), coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, microwave, and satellite.    <br />Telephone Lines [1] Inexpensive, multiple-conductor cable comprised of one or more pairs    <br />of 18 to 24 gauge copper strands. The strands are twisted to improve protection against    <br />electromagnetic and radio frequency interference. The cable, which may be either shielded or    <br />unshielded, is used in low-speed communications, as telephone cable. It is used only in baseband    <br />networks because of its narrow bandwidth. Most telephone lines you see strung on poles consist    <br />of cables made up of hundreds of copper wires are twisted pairs. Twisted pairs are susceptible to    <br />a variety of types of electrical interference (noise), which limits the practical distance that data</p>
<p>can be transmitted without being garbled. Twisted pairs have been used for years for voice and   <br />data transmission, however they are now being phased out by more technically advanced and    <br />reliable media.    <br />Coaxial Cable </p>
<p>Coaxial cable is a type of thickly insulated copper wire that can carry a   <br />larger volume of data—about 100 million bits per second, the insulation is composed of a    <br />nonconductive material covered by a layer of woven wire mesh and heavy-duty rubber or plastic.    <br />In terms of number of telephone connections, a coaxial cable has 80 times the transmission    <br />capacity of twisted pair. Coaxial cables are most often used as the primary communications    <br />medium for local connected network in which all computer communication is within a limited    <br />geographic area, such as in the same building.    <br />Coaxial cable is also used for undersea telephone lines.    <br />Fiber-Optic Cable [2]</p>
<p>A transmission medium composed of a central glass optical fiber   <br />cable surrounded by cladding and an outer protective sheath. It transmits digital signals in the    <br />form of modulated light from a laser or LED (light-emitting diode). In fiber-optic cable, data is    <br />transmitted as pulses of light through tubes of glass. In terms of number of telephone connections,    <br />fiber-optic cable has 20,000 times the transmission capacity of twisted pair. However, it is    <br />significantly smaller. Indeed, a fiber-optic tube can be half the diameter of a human hair.    <br />Although limited in the distance they can carry information, fiber-optic cables have several    <br />advantages. Such cables are immune to electronic interference, which makes them more secure.    <br />They are also lighter and less expensive than coaxial cable and are more reliable at transmitting    <br />data. They transmit information using beams of light at light speeds instead of pulses of    <br />electricity, making them far faster than copper cable. Fiber-optic cable is rapidly replacing    <br />twisted-pair telephone lines.    <br />Microwave </p>
<p>Instead of using wire or cables, microwave systems can use the atmosphere as   <br />the medium through which to transmit signals. Microwaves are high-frequency radio waves that    <br />travel in straight lines through the air. Because the waves cannot bend with the curvature of the    <br />earth, they can be transmitted only over short distances. Thus, microwave is a good medium for    <br />sending data between buildings in a city or on a large college campus. For longer distances, the    <br />waves must be relayed by means of &quot;dishes&quot;, or antennas. These can be installed on towers, high    <br />buildings, and mountaintops. Each tower facility receives incoming traffic, boosts the signal    <br />strength, and sends the signal to the next station.    <br />Satellites [3]</p>
<p>Satellite communications refers to the utilization of geostationary orbiting   <br />satellites to relay the transmission received from one earth station to one or more earth stations.    <br />They are the outcome of research in the area of communications whose objective is to achieve    <br />ever-increasing ranges and capacities with the lowest possible costs. Orbiting about 22,000 miles    <br />above the earth, satellites rotate at a precise point and speed above the earth. This makes them    <br />appear stationary so they can amplify and relay microwave signals from one transmitter on the    <br />ground to another. The primary advantage of satellite communication is the amount of area that can    <br />be covered by a single satellite. It also has other features: long communication distance, and the</p>
<p>cost of station building is independent of the communication distance, operating in broadcasting   <br />mode, easy for multiple access, sustaining heavy traffic, able to transport different types of service,    <br />independent sending and receiving, and monitoring. Three satellites placed in particular orbits can    <br />cover the entire surface of the earth, with some overlap. Their only drawback is that bad weather    <br />can sometimes interrupt the flow of data.</p>
