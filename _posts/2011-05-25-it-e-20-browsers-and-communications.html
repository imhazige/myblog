<p>Want to communicate with a friend across town, in another province, or even in another   <br />country? The Internet and the WEB are the 21st-Century information resources designed for all    <br />of us to use.    <br />Browsers are programs that provide access to Web resources. This software connects you to    <br />remote computers, opens and transfers files, displays text and images, and provides in one tool an    <br />uncomplicated interface to the Internet and Web documents. Two well-known browsers are    <br />Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. For browsers to connect to other resources,    <br />the location or address of the resources must be specified. These addresses are called Uniform    <br />Resources Locators (URLs). Following the Domain Name System (DNS), all URLs have at least    <br />three basic parts. The first part presents the protocol used to connect to the resource. The protocol    <br />http:// is by far the most common. The second part presents the domain name or the name of the    <br />server where the resource is located. The server is identified as www.aol.com. (Many URLs have    <br />additional parts specifying directory paths, file names, and pointers.) The last part of the domain    <br />name following the dot (.) is the domain code. It identifies the type of organization. For example,    <br />com indicated a commercial site.    <br />The URL http://www.aol.com connects your computer to a computer that provides    <br />information about America Online (AOL). These informational locations on the Web are called    <br />Web sites. Moving from one Web site to another is called surfing.    <br />Once the browser has connected to a Web site, a document file is sent to your computer.    <br />This document contains Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) commands. The browser    <br />interprets the HTML commands and displays the document as a Web page. Typically, the first    <br />page of a Web site is referred to as its home page. [1]The home page presents information about    <br />the site along with references and hyperlinks, or connections to other documents that contain    <br />related information such as text files, graphic images, audio, and video clips.    <br />These documents may be located on a nearby computer system or on one halfway around    <br />the world. The references appear as underlined and colored text and /or images on the Web page.    <br />To access the referenced material, all you do is click on the highlighted text or image. A link is    <br />automatically made to the computer containing the material, and the referenced material appears.    <br />Communication is the most popular Internet activity. The impact of electronic communication    <br />cannot be overestimated. At a personal level, friends and family can stay in contact with one another    <br />even when separated by thousands of miles. [2]At a business level, electronic communication has    <br />become standard and many times preferred way to stay in touch with suppliers, employees, and    <br />customers.    <br />You can communicate with anyone in the world who has an Internet address or e-mail</p>
<p>account with a system connected to the Internet. All you need is access to the Internet and an   <br />e-mail program. Two of the most widely used e-mail programs are Microsoft's Outlook Express    <br />and Netscape's Navigator.    <br />Suppose that you have a friend, Anny, who is going to the University of Southern California.    <br />You and Anny have been planning a trip for the upcoming break. You have heard there are some    <br />inexpensive airfare deals online. To save money, you and Anny agree to research these offers and    <br />e-mail each other your findings.    <br />A typical e-mail message has three basic elements: header, message and signature. The    <br />header appears first and typically includes the following information:    <br />Addresses: Addresses of the persons sending, receiving, and, optionally, anyone else    <br />who is to receive copies.    <br />Subject: A one-line description, used to present the topic of the message. Subject lines    <br />typically are displayed when a person checks his or her mail-box.    <br />Attachments: Many e-mail programs allow you to attach files such as documents and    <br />worksheets. If a message has an attachment, the file name appears on the attachment    <br />line.    <br />The letter or message comes next. It is typically short and to the point. Finally, the signature    <br />line provides additional information about the sender. Typically, this information includes the    <br />sender's name, address, and telephone number.    <br />Following the domain name system discussed earlier, e-mail addresses have two basic parts.    <br />The first part is the user's name and the second part is the domain name, which includes the    <br />domain code.    <br />You can also use e-mail to communicate with people you do not know but with whom you    <br />wish to share ideas and interests. You can participate in discussions and debates that range from    <br />general topics like current events and movies to specialized forums like computer troubleshooting    <br />and Star Trek.    <br />Mailing lists allow members of a mailing list to communicate by sending messages to a list    <br />address. Each message is then copied and sent via e-mail to every member of the mailing list. To    <br />participate in a mailing list, you must first subscribe by sending an e-mail request to the mailing    <br />list subscription address. Once you are a member of a list, you can expect to receive e-mail from    <br />other on the list. You may find the number of messages to be overwhelming. If you want to    <br />cancel a mailing list, send an e-mail request to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; to the subscription address.    <br />Newsgroups, unlike mailing lists, use a special network of computers called the Usenet.    <br />Each of these computers maintains the newsgroups listing. There are over 10,000 different    <br />newsgroups organized into major topic areas that are further subdivided into subtopics.    <br />Contributions to a particular newsgroup are sent to one of the computers on the Usenet. This    <br />computer saves the messages on its system and periodically shares all its recent messages with    <br />the other computers on the Usenet. Unlike mailing lists, a copy of each message is not sent to    <br />each member of a list. Rather, interested individuals check contributions to a particular</p>
<p>newsgroup, reading only those of interest. There are thousands of newsgroups covering a wide   <br />variety of topic areas.    <br />Chat groups allow direct &quot;live&quot; communication. To participate, you join a chat group, select    <br />a channel or topic, and communicate live with others by typing words on your computer. Other    <br />members of your channel immediately see those words on their computers and can respond in the    <br />same manner. One popular chat service is called Internet Relay Chat (IRC). This software is    <br />available free from several locations on the Internet. Using the chat-client software, you log on to    <br />the server, select a channel or topic in which you are interested, and begin chatting. To participate,    <br />you need access to a server or computer that supports IRC. This is done using special chat-client    <br />software.    <br />Instant messaging, like chat groups, allows one or more people to communicate via direct,    <br />&quot;live&quot; communication. Instant messaging, however, provides greater control and flexibility than    <br />chat groups. To use instant messaging, you specify a list of friends, or &quot;buddies&quot;, and register    <br />with an instant messaging server. Whenever you connect to the Internet, you use special software    <br />to tell your messaging server that you are online too. It notifies you if any of your buddies are    <br />online. At the same time, it notifies your buddies that you are online. You can then send    <br />messages back and forth to one another instantly.    <br />Before you submit a contribution to a discussion group, it is recommended that you observe    <br />or read the communications from others. This is called lurking. By lurking, you can learn about    <br />the culture of a discussion group. For example, you can observe the level and style of the    <br />discussions. You may decide that a particular discussion group is not what you were looking for    <br />in which case, unsubscribe. If the discussions are appropriate and you wish to participate, try    <br />to fit into the prevailing culture. Remember that your contributions will likely be read by    <br />hundreds of people.</p>
