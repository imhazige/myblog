Today, I makes my favourite indie game [opensource on github](https://github.com/imhazige/AeroEgg).

## The Indie Games I Made
I made it in year 2017, after creates 2 other indie game Karaok Kong and Mouse Bee and Elephant.

I made these games all by myself, art, sounds, music, coding, etc... 

I spend most of my spare time on these games. 

I did not have a big expect that these games will give me much money. Just that I had a wish, as I was so obsessed by playing game, I want to build a game that other players like to play. 

I will be the creator of the sprites in the games. Also, I like art, I am not very like most style of current popular 3D games.  

## How Many I earned from these 3 games.
The result is that I earned -490$ by these 3 indie games. -500$ for App Store fee. +20$ for Unity Ads earning LOL!

No more than 50 people download the games from App Store as I think. 

Some of my firends like the `Karaok Kong`, and they said `Aero Egg` is too hard, but they like the art!

## Goodbye, Indie Game
And now, I have created the 3 games, I like them, I like playing `Karaok Kong`, I feel `Aero Egg` a bit hard, I keep making it easier.

I think I satisfied my desire. I am proud of the game I have made, I like the art in the `Aero Egg`.

Now, I decide to say good bye to indie game journey. I will not create any game anymore, I opensource `Aero Egg`, as a souvenir.
