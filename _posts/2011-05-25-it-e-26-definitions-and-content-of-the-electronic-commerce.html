<p>Electronic Commerce over the Internet is a new concept. In recent years, it has become so   <br />broadly used that it is often left undifferentiated from other current trends which rely on    <br />automation, such as concurrent engineering and just in time manufacturing. Many companies,    <br />including CyberCash, Dig Cash,First Virtual, and Open Market had provided a variety of    <br />electronic commerce services.    <br />[1] If you have access to a personal computer (PC) and can connect to the Internet with a    <br />browser, you can do business online. No more worries about programming. No more searching    <br />for outdated catalogs as a customer or printing catalogs as a merchant. No more looking for    <br />phone numbers, paying long-distance to connect, or keeping the store open late into the evening.    <br />Just get on the Web, open an online store, and watch your business grow.    <br />The wired world of business, developed technology, human talent, and a new way of doing    <br />business make up today's growing worldwide economy. The backbone of this electronic    <br />commerce is the Internet. The wired world is not about technology, it is about information,    <br />decision making and communication. The wired world is changing life for everyone, from the    <br />single household to the largest corporation. [2]No business can afford to ignore the potential of a    <br />connected economy.    <br />Electronic commerce is anemergingconcept that describes the process of buying and</p>
<p>selling or exchanging of products, services, and information via computer networks including the   <br />Internet. Kalakota and Whinston (1997) define EC from these perspectives:    <br />From a communications perspective, EC is the delivery of information, products/services, or    <br />payments over telephone lines, computer networks, or any other electronic means.    <br />From a business process perspective, EC is the application of technology toward the    <br />automation of business transactions and work flow.    <br />From a service perspective, EC is a tool that addresses the desire of firms, consumers, and    <br />management to cut service costs while improving the quality of goods and increasing the speed    <br />of service delivery.    <br />From an on-line perspective, EC provides the capability of buying and selling products and    <br />information on the Internet and other on-line services.    <br />The term commerce is viewed by some as transactions conducted between business partners.    <br />Therefore, the term electronic commerce seems to be fairly narrow to some people. Thus, many    <br />use the term e-business. It refers to a broader definition of EC, not just buying and selling but    <br />also servicing customers and collaborating with business partners, and conducting electronic    <br />transactions within an organization. According to Lou Gerstner, IBM's CEO: &quot;E-business is all    <br />about cycle time, speed, globalization, enhanced productivity, reaching new customers and    <br />sharing knowledge across institutions for competitive advantage.&quot;    <br />Just like any other type of commerce, electronic commerce involves two parties: businesses    <br />and consumers. There are three basic types of electronic commerce.    <br />Business-to-Consumer (B2C): These areretailingtransactions with individual shoppers. The    <br />typical shopper at Amazon.com is a consumer, or a customer. Oftentimes, this arrangement    <br />eliminates the middleman by providing manufacturers direct sales to customers. Other times,    <br />retail stores create a presence on the Web as another way to reach customers.    <br />Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C): This category involves individuals selling to individuals.    <br />This often takes the form of an electronic version of the classified ads or anauction. Goods are    <br />described and interested buyers contact sellers tonegotiateprices. [3]Unlike traditional sales via    <br />classified ads and auctions, buyers and sellers typically never meet face-to-face. Examples are    <br />individuals selling in classified ads and selling residential property, cars, and so on. Advertising    <br />personal services on the Internet and selling knowledge and expertise is another example of C2C.    <br />Several auction sites allow individuals to put items up for auctions. Finally , many individuals are    <br />using internal networks to advertise items for sale or service.    <br />Business-to-Business (B2B): This category involves the sale of a product or service from    <br />one business to another. This is typically a manufacturer-supplier relationship. For example, a    <br />furniture manufacturer requires raw materials such as wood, paint, andvarnish. In B2B electronic    <br />commerce, manufacturers electronically place orders with suppliers and many times payment is    <br />made electronically.    <br />Many people think EC is just having a Web site, but EC is much more than that. There are    <br />dozens of applications of EC such as home banking, shopping in on-line stores and malls, buying</p>
<p>stocks, finding a job, conducting an auction, and collaborating electronically on research and   <br />development projects. To execute these applications, it is necessary to have supporting information    <br />and organizational infrastructure and systems. EC applications are supported by infrastructures, and    <br />their implementation is dependent on four major areas: people, public policy, technical standards    <br />and protocols, and other organizations. The EC management coordinates the applications,    <br />infrastructures, andpillars.</p>
