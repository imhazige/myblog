<p>SQL (pronounced &quot;ess-que-el&quot;) stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to    <br />communicate with a database. According to ANSI, it is the standard language for relational     <br />database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on     <br />a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management     <br />systems that use SQL are:Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. [1]Although     <br />most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary     <br />extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands     <br />such as &quot;Select&quot;, &quot;Insert&quot;, &quot;Update&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Create&quot;, and &quot;Drop&quot; can be used to accomplish     <br />almost everything that one needs to do with a database.     <br />A relational database system contains one or more objects called tables. The data or     <br />information for the database are stored in these tables. Tables are uniquely identified by their     <br />names and are comprised of columns and rows. Columns contain the column name, data type,     <br />and any other attributes for the column. Rows contain the records or data for the columns. Here is     <br />a sample table called &quot;weather&quot;.     <br />City, state, high, and low are the columns. The rows contain the data for this table:</p>
<p>The select statement is used to query the database and retrieve selected data that match the    <br />criteria that you specify. Here is the format of a simple select statement:     <br />select &quot;column1&quot;     <br />[,&quot;column2&quot;,etc]     <br />from &quot;tablename&quot;     <br />[where &quot;condition&quot;];     <br />[] = optional</p>
<p>The column names that follow the select keyword determine which columns will be returned    <br />in the results. You can select as many column names that you'd like, or you can use a &quot;*&quot; to     <br />select all columns.     <br />The table name that follows the keyword from specifies the table that will be queried to     <br />retrieve the desired results.     <br />The where <font color="#0000ff">clause</font> (optional) specifies which data values or rows will be returned or     <br />displayed, based on the criteria described after the keyword where.     <br />The create table statement is used to create a new table. Here is the format of a simple create     <br />table statement:     <br />create table &quot;tablename&quot;     <br />(&quot;column1&quot; &quot;data type&quot;,     <br />&quot;column2&quot; &quot;data type&quot;,     <br />&quot;column3&quot; &quot;data type&quot;);     <br />Format of create table if you were to use optional constraints:     <br />create table &quot;tablename&quot;     <br />(&quot;column1&quot; &quot;data type&quot;     <br />[constraint],     <br />&quot;column2&quot; &quot;data type&quot;     <br />[constraint],     <br />&quot;column3&quot; &quot;data type&quot;     <br />[constraint]);     <br />[ ] = optional     <br />Note: You may have as many columns as you'd like, and the constraints are optional.     <br />Example:     <br />create table employee     <br />(first varchar(15),     <br />last varchar(20),     <br />age number(3),     <br />address varchar(30),     <br />city varchar(20),     <br />state varchar(20));     <br />[2]To create a new table, enter the keywords create table followed by the table name,     <br />followed by an open <font color="#0000ff">parenthesis</font>, followed by the first column name, followed by the data type     <br />for that column, followed by any optional constraints, and followed by a closing parenthesis. It is     <br />important to make sure you use an open parenthesis before the beginning table, and a closing     <br />parenthesis after the end of the last column definition. Make sure you separate each column     <br />definition with a comma. All SQL statements should end with a &quot;;&quot;.     <br />The table and column names must start with a letter and can be followed by letters, numbers,</p>
<p>or underscores ê not to exceed a total of 30 characters in length. Do not use any SQL reserved    <br />keywords as names for tables or column names (such as &quot;select&quot;, &quot;create&quot;, &quot;insert&quot;, etc).     <br />Data types specify what the type of data can be for that particular column. If a column     <br />called &quot;Last_Name&quot;, is to be used to hold names, then that particular column should have a     <br />&quot;varchar&quot; (variable-length character) data type.     <br />Note:Here are the most common data types:     <br />char(size) Fixed-length character string. Size is specified in parenthesis. Max 255 bytes.     <br />varchar(size) Variable-length character string. Max size is specified in parenthesis.     <br />number(size) Number value with a max number of column digits specified in parenthesis.     <br />Date Date value     <br />number(size,d)     <br />Number value with a maximum number of digits of &quot;size&quot; total, with a     <br />maximum number of &quot;d&quot; digits to the right of the decimal.     <br />What are constraints? When tables are created, it is common for one or more columns to     <br />have constraints associated with them. A constraint is basically a rule associated with a column     <br />that the data entered into that column must follow. For example, a &quot;unique&quot; constraint specifies     <br />that no two records can have the same value in a particular column. They must all be unique. The     <br />other two most popular constraints are &quot;not null&quot; which specifies that a column can't be left blank,     <br />and &quot;primary key&quot;. A &quot;primary key&quot; constraint defines a unique identification of each record (or     <br />row) in a table.     <br />The insert statement is used to insert or add a row of data into the table.     <br />To insert records into a table, enter the key words insert into followed by the table name,     <br />followed by an open parenthesis, followed by a list of column names separated by commas,     <br />followed by a closing parenthesis, followed by the keyword values, followed by the list of values     <br />enclosed in parenthesis. The values that you enter will be held in the rows and they will match up     <br />with the column names that you specify. Strings should be enclosed in single quotes, and     <br />numbers should not.     <br />insert into &quot;tablename&quot;     <br />(first_column,...last_column)     <br />values (first_value,...last_value);     <br />In the example below, the column name first will match up with the value 'Luke', and the     <br />column name state will match up with the value 'Georgia'.     <br />Example:     <br />insert into employee     <br />(first, last, age, address, city, state)     <br />values ('Luke', 'Duke', 45, '2130 Boars Nest',     <br />'Hazard Co', 'Georgia');     <br />Note: All strings should be enclosed between single quotes: 'string'</p>
<p>Updating Records    <br />The update statement is used to update or change records that match a specified <font color="#0000ff">criteria</font>.     <br />This is accomplished by carefully constructing a where clause.     <br />update &quot;tablename&quot;     <br />set &quot;columnname&quot; =     <br />&quot;newvalue&quot;     <br />[,&quot;nextcolumn&quot; =     <br />&quot;newvalue2&quot;...]     <br />where &quot;columnname&quot;     <br />OPERATOR &quot;value&quot;     <br />[and|or &quot;column&quot;     <br />OPERATOR &quot;value&quot;];     <br />[ ] = optional     <br />Examples:     <br />update phone_book     <br />set area_code = 623     <br />where prefix = 979;     <br />update phone_book     <br />set last_name = 'Smith', prefix=555, suffix=9292     <br />where last_name = 'Jones';     <br />update employee     <br />set age = age+1     <br />where first_name='Mary' and last_name='Williams';     <br />Deleting Records     <br />The delete statement is used to delete records or rows from the table.     <br />delete from &quot;tablename&quot;     <br />where &quot;columnname&quot;     <br />OPERATOR &quot;value&quot;     <br />[and|or &quot;column&quot;     <br />OPERATOR &quot;value&quot;];     <br />[ ] = optional     <br />Examples:     <br />delete from employee;     <br />Note: if you leave off the where clause, all records will be deleted!     <br />delete from employee     <br />where lastname = 'May';     <br />delete from employee     <br />where firstname = 'Mike' or firstname = 'Eric';</p>
<p>To delete an entire record/row from a table, enter &quot;delete from&quot; followed by the table name,    <br />followed by the where clause which contains the conditions to delete. If you leave off the where     <br />clause, all records will be deleted.     <br />The drop table command is used to delete a table and all rows in the table.     <br />To delete an entire table including all of its rows, issue the drop table command followed by     <br />the table name. Drop table is different from deleting all of the records in the table. Deleting all of     <br />the records in the table leaves the table including column and constraint information. Dropping     <br />the table removes the table definition as well as all of its rows.     <br />drop table &quot;tablename&quot;     <br />Example:     <br />drop table myemployees_ts0211;</p>
