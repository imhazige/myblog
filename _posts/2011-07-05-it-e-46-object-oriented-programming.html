<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a special type of programming that combines   <br />data structures with functions to create re-usable objects.    <br />Otherwise, the term object-oriented is generally used to describe a system that deals primarily    <br />with different types of objects, and where you can take the actions depends on what type of object    <br />you are manipulating. For example, an object-oriented draw program might enable you to draw    <br />many types of objects, such as circles, rectangles, triangles, etc. Applying the same action to each of    <br />these objects, however, would produce different results. If the action is Make 3D, for instance, the    <br />result would be a sphere, box, and pyramid, respectively.    <br />Many languages support object oriented programming. In OOP data and functions are    <br />grouped together in objects (encapsulation). An object is a particular instance of a class. [1] Each    <br />object can contain different data, but all objects belonging to a class have the same functions    <br />(called methods). So you could have a program with many e-mail objects, containing different    <br />messages, but they would all have the same functionality, fixed by the email class. Objects often    <br />restrict access to the data (data hiding).    <br />Classes are a lot like types the exact relationship between types and classes can be complicated    <br />and varies from language to language.    <br />Via inheritance, hierarchies of objects can share and modify particular functions. You may    <br />have code in one class that describes the features all e-mails have (a sender and a date, for    <br />example) and then, in a sub-class for email containing pictures, add functions that display images.    <br />[2]Often in the program you will refer to an e-mail object as if it was the parent (super-class)    <br />because it will not matter whether the e-mail contains a picture, or sound, or just text. This code    <br />will not need to be altered when you add another sub-class of e-mail objects, containing (say)    <br />electronic cash.    <br />Sometimes you may want an action on a super-class to produce a result that depends on    <br />what sub-class it &quot;really is&quot;. For example, you may want to display a list of email objects and    <br />want each sub-class (text, image, etc) to display in a different colour. In many languages it is    <br />possible for the super-class to have functions that sub-classes change to suit their own purposes    <br />(polymorphism, implemented by the compiler using a technique called dynamic binding). So    <br />each email sub-class may supply an alternative to the default, printing function, with its own    <br />colour.    <br />In many OO languages it is possible to find out what class an object is (run time type    <br />information) and even what functions are connected with it (introspection / reflection). Others,    <br />like C++ have little run time information available (at least in the standard language individual    <br />libraries of objects can support RTTI with their own conventions).    <br />[3]There are at least three approaches to OO languages: Methods in Classes, Multi-Methods    <br />Separate from Classes, Prototypes.</p>
<p>Many languages follow Smalltalk in associating functions (methods) with classes. The   <br />methods form part of a class definition and the language implementation will have (this is a    <br />low-level detail hidden from the programmer) a vtable for each class which links methods to their    <br />implementations. This indirection is necessary to allow polymorphism, but introduces a    <br />performance penalty. In some languages (C++, at least), only some methods, marked as virtual    <br />by the programmer, are treated in this way.    </p>
<p>Some languages (e.g. common Lisp / CLOS) allow functions to specialise on the class of    <br />any variable that they are passed (multi-methods). Functions cannot be associated with one class    <br />because different versions of the function may exist for many different combinations of classes.    </p>
<p>Other OO languages do away with classes completely (e.g. Self). Prototype-based languages    <br />create new objects using an existing object as an example (prototype). Apart from solving some    <br />problems with dynamic object creation, this approach also encourages delegation (function calls    <br />are passed to other objects) rather than inheritance.</p>
