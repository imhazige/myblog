<p>Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. [1]Management of   <br />data involves both defining structures for storage of information and providing mechanisms for    <br />the manipulation of information. In addition, the database system must ensure the safety of the    <br />information stored, <font color="#0000ff">despite</font> system crashes or attempts at unauthorized access. If data are to be    <br />shared among several users, the system must avoid possible <font color="#0000ff">anomalous </font>results.    <br />Because information is so important in most organizations, computer scientists have    <br />developed a large body of concepts and techniques for managing data.    <br />Databases are widely used. Here are some representative applications:    <br />Banking: For customer information, accounts, and loans, and banking transactions.    <br />Airlines: For reservations and schedule information Airlines were among the first to use    <br />databases in a geographically distributed mannerêterminals situated around the world accessed    <br />the central database system through phone lines and other data networks.    <br />Universities: For student information, course registrations, and grades.    <br />Credit card transactions: For purchases on credit cards and generation of monthly statements.    <br />Telecommunication: For keeping records of calls made, generating monthly bills, maintaining    <br />balances on prepaid calling cards, and storing information about the communication networks.    <br />Finance: For storing information about holdings, sales, and purchases of financial instruments    <br />such as stocks and bonds.    <br />Sales: For customer, product, and purchase information.    <br />Manufacturing: For management of supply chain and for tracking production of items in    <br />factories, inventories of items in warehouses/stores, and orders for items.    <br />Human Resources: For information about employees, salaries, <font color="#0000ff">payroll </font>taxes and benefits,    <br />and for generation of paychecks.    <br />Databases form an essential part of almost all enterprises today.    <br />Over the course of the last four decades of the twentieth century, use of databases grew in    <br />all enterprises. In the early days, very few people interacted directly with database systems,    <br />although without realizing it they interacted with databases indirectlyêthrough printed reports    <br />such as credit card statements, or through agents such as bank tellers and airline reservation    <br />agents. Then automated teller machines came along and let users interact directly with databases.    <br />Phone interfaces to computers (interactive voice response systems) also allowed users to deal    <br />directly with databasesêa caller could dial a number, and press phone keys to enter information    <br />or to select alternative options, to find flight arrival/departure times, for example, or to register    <br />for courses in a university.    <br />The Internet revolution of the late 1990s sharply increased direct user access to databases.    <br />Organizations converted many of their phone interfaces to databases into Web interfaces, and</p>
<p>made a variety of services and information available online. For instance, when you access an   <br />online bookstore and browse a book or music collection, you are accessing data stored in a    <br />database. When you enter an order online, your order is stored in a database. When you access a    <br />bank Web site and retrieve your bank balance and transaction information, the information is    <br />retrieved from the bank's database system. When you access a Web site, information about you    <br />may be retrieved from a database, to select which advertisements should be shown to you.    <br />Furthermore, data about your Web accesses may be stored in a database.    <br />Thus, although user interfaces hide details of access to a database, and most people are not    <br />even aware they are dealing with a database, accessing databases forms an essential part of    <br />almost everyone's life today.    <br />The importance of database systems can be judged in another way today, database system    <br />vendors like Oracle are among the largest software companies in the world, and database systems    <br />form an important part of the product line of more <font color="#0000ff">diversified</font> companies like Microsoft and IBM.</p>
