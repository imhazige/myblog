<p>A database management system (DBMS) is an important type of programming system, used   <br />today on the biggest and the smallest computers. [1]As for other major forms of system software,    <br />such as compilers and operating systems, a well-understood set of principles for database    <br />management systems has developed over the years, and these concepts are useful both for    <br />understanding how to use these systems effectively and for designing and implementing DBMS's.    <br />DBMS is a collection of programs that enables you to store, modify, and extract information    <br />from a database. There are many different types of DBMS's, ranging from small systems that run    <br />on personal computers to huge systems that run on mainframes. The following are the location of    <br />database between application programs and end-users.</p>
<p>There are two qualities that distinguish database management systems from other sorts of   <br />programming systems.    <br />1) The ability to manage persistent data, and    <br />2) The ability to access large amounts of data efficiently.</p>
<p>Point 1) merely states that there is a database which exists permanently; the contents of this    <br />database is the data that a DBMS accesses and manages. </p>
<p>Point 2) distinguishes a DBMS from a   <br />file system, which also manages persistent data. A DBMS's capabilities are needed most when    <br />the amount of data is very large, because for small amounts of data, simple access techniques,    <br />such as linear scans of the data, are usually adequate.    <br />[2]While we regard the above two properties of a DBMS as fundamental, there are a number    <br />of other capabilities that are almost universally found in commercial DBMS's. These are:    <br /> Support for at least one data model, or mathematical abstraction through which the user can    <br />view the data.</p>
<p> Support for certain high-level languages that allow the user to define the structure of data,   <br />access data, and manipulate data.    <br /> Transaction management, the capability to provide correct, concurrent access to the database    <br />by many users at once.    <br /> Access control, the ability to limit access to data by unauthorized users, and the ability to    <br />check the validity of data.    <br /> Resiliency, the ability to recover from system failures without losing data.    <br />Data Models Each DBMS provides at least one abstract model of data that allows the user    <br />to see information not as raw bits, but in more understandable terms. In fact, it is usually possible    <br />to see data at several levels of abstraction. At a relatively low level, a DBMS commonly allows    <br />us to visualize data as composed of files.    <br />Efficient File Access The ability to store a file is not remarkable: the file system associated    <br />with any operating system does that. The capability of a DBMS is seen when we access the data of    <br />a file. For example, suppose we wish to find the manager of employee &quot;Clark Kent&quot;. If the    <br />company has thousands of employees, It is very expensive to search the entire file to find the one    <br />with NAME=&quot;Clark Kent&quot;. A DBMS helps us to set up &quot;index files,&quot; or &quot;indices,&quot; that allow us to    <br />access the record for &quot;Clark Kent&quot; in essentially one stroke no matter how large the file is. Likewise,    <br />insertion of new records or deletion of old ones can be accomplished in time that is small and    <br />essentially constant, independent of the file’s length. Another thing a DBMS helps us do is navigate    <br />among files, that is, to combine values in two or more files to obtain the information we want.    <br />Query Languages To make access to files easier, a DBMS provides a query language, or    <br />data manipulation language, to express operations on files. Query languages differ in the level of    <br />detail they require of the user, with systems based on the relational data model generally    <br />requiring less detail than languages based on other models.</p>
<p>Transaction Management </p>
<p>Another important capability of a DBMS is the ability to   <br />manage simultaneously large numbers of transactions, which are procedures operating on the    <br />database. Some databases are so large that they can only be useful if they are operated upon    <br />simultaneously by many computers: often these computers are dispersed around the country or    <br />the world. The database systems used by banks, accessed almost instantaneously by hundreds or    <br />thousands of automated <font color="#0000ff">teller</font> machines (ATM), as well as by an equal or greater number of    <br />employees in the bank branches, is typical of this sort of database. An airline <font color="#0000ff">reservation</font> system    <br />is another good example.    <br />Sometimes, two accesses do not interfere with each other. For example, any number of    <br />transactions can be reading your bank balance at the same time, without any inconsistency. [3]But    <br />if you are in the bank depositing your salary check <font color="#0000ff">at the exact instant</font> your spouse is extracting    <br />money from an automatic teller, the result of the two transactions occurring simultaneously and    <br />without coordination is unpredictable. Thus, transactions that modify a data item must “lock out”    <br />other transactions trying to read or write that item at the same time. A DBMS must therefore    <br />provide some form of concurrency control to prevent uncoordinated access to the same data item</p>
<p>by more than one transaction.   <br />Even more complex problems occur when the database is distributed over many different    <br />computer systems, perhaps with duplication of data to allow both faster local access and to    <br />protect against the destruction of data if one computer crashes.    <br />Security of Data A DBMS must not only protect against loss of data when crashes occur,    <br />as we just mentioned, but it must prevent unauthorized access. For example, only users with a    <br />certain clearance should have access to the salary field of an employee file, and the DBMS must    <br />be able associate with the various users their privileges to see files, fields within files, or other    <br />subsets of the data in the database. Thus a DBMS must maintain a table telling for each user    <br />known to it, what access privileges the user has for each object. For example, one user may be    <br />allowed to read a file, but not to insert or delete data; another may not be allowed to see the file at    <br />all, while a third may be allowed to read or modify the file <font color="#0000ff">at will</font>.    </p>
<p>DBMS Types   <br />Designers developed three different types of database structures: <font color="#0000ff">hierarchical</font>, network, and    <br />relational. Hierarchical and network were first developed but relational has become dominant.    <br />While the relational design is dominant, the older databases have not been dropped. Companies    <br />that installed a hierarchical system such as IMS in the 1970s will be using and maintaining these    <br />databases for years to come even though new development is being done on relational systems.    <br />These older systems are often referred to as legacy systems.</p>
