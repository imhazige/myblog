<p>Computer hardware has four parts: the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, storage   <br />hardware, input hardware, and output hardware.    <br />The part of the computer that runs the program is known as the processor or central processing    <br />unit (CPU). In a microcomputer, the CPU is on a single electronic component, the microprocessor    <br />chip, within the system unit or system cabinet. The CPU itself has two parts: the control unit and    <br />the arithmetic-logic unit. In a microcomputer, these are both on the microcomputer chip.    <br />The Control Unit The control unit tells the rest of the computer system how to carry out a    <br />program's instructions. It directs the movement of electronic signals between memory and the    <br />arithmetic-logic unit. It also directs these control signals between the CPU and input and output    <br />devices.    <br />The Arithmetic-Logic Unit The arithmetic-logic unit, usually called the ALU, performs    <br />two types of operations—arithmetic and logical. Arithmetic operations are, as you might expect,    <br />the fundamental math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logical    <br />operations consist of comparisons. That is , two pieces of data are compared to see whether one is    <br />equal to, less than, or greater than the other.    <br />Memory Memory is also known as primary storage, internal storage, it temporarily holds    <br />data, program instructions, and information. One of the most important facts to know about    <br />memory is that part of its content is held only temporarily. In other words, it is stored only as    <br />long as the computer is turned on. When you turn the machine off, the content immediately    <br />vanish. The stored contents in memory are volatile and can vanish very quickly.    <br />Storage Hardware [1]The purpose of storage hardware is to provide a means of storing    <br />computer instructions and data in a form that is relatively permanent, that is, the data is not lost    <br />when the power is turned off—and easy to retrieve when needed for processing.There are four    <br />kinds of storage hardware: floppy disks, hard disks,optical disk,andmagnetic tape.    <br />Floppy Disks Floppy disks are also called diskettes, flexible disks, floppies, or simply</p>
<p>disks. The plastic disk inside the diskette cover is flexible, not rigid. They are flat, circular pieces   <br />of mylar plastic that rotate within a jacket. Data and programs are stored as electromagnetic    <br />charges on a metal oxide film coating the mylar plastic.    <br />Hard Disks Hard disks consist of metallic rather than plastic platters. They are tightly    <br />sealed to prevent any foreign matter from getting inside. Hard disks are extremely sensitive    <br />instruments. The read-write head rides on a cushion of air about 0.000001 inch thick. It is so thin    <br />that a smoke particle, fingerprint, dust, or human hair could cause what is known as a head crash.    <br />A head crash happens when the surface of the read-write head or particles on its surface contact    <br />the magnetic disk surface. A head crash is a disaster for a hard disk. It means that some or all of    <br />the data on the disk is destroyed. Hard disks are assembled under sterile conditions and sealed    <br />from impurities within their permanent containers.    <br />Optical Disks Optical disks are used for storing great quantities of data. An optical disk can    <br />hold 650 megabytes of data—the equivalent of hundreds of floppy disks. Moreover, an optical disk    <br />makes an immense amount of information available on a microcomputer. In optical-disk technology,    <br />a laser beamalters the surface of a plastic or metallic disk to represent data. To read the data, a laser    <br />scans these areas and sends the data to a computer chip for conversion.    <br />Magnetic Tape Magnetic tape is an effective way of making a backup, or duplicate, copy of    <br />your programs and data. We mentioned the alarming consequences that can happen if a hard disk    <br />suffers a head crash. You will lose some or all of your data or programs. Of course, you can always    <br />make copies of your hard-disk files on floppy disks. However, this can be time-consuming and may    <br />require many floppy disks. Magnetic tape is sequential access storage and can solve the problem    <br />mentioned above.    <br />Input Hardware Input devices take data and programs people can read or understand and    <br />convert them to a form the computer can process. This is the machine-readable electronic signals    <br />of 0s and 1s. Input hardware is of two kinds: keyboard entry and direct entry.    <br />Keyboard Entry Data is input to the computer through a keyboard that looks like a    <br />typewriter keyboard but has additional keys. In this method, the user typically reads from an    <br />original document called the source document. The user enters that document by typing on the    <br />keyboard.    <br />Direct Entry :Data is made into machine-readable form as it is entered into the computer,    <br />no keyboard is used. Direct entry devices may be categorized into three areas: pointing devices    <br />(for example, mouse, touch screen, light pen, digitizer are all pointing devices), scanning devices    <br />(for example, image scanner, fax machine, bar-code reader are all scanning devices), and    <br />voice-input devices.    <br />Output Hardware Output devices convert machine-readable information into people-readable    <br />form. Common output devices are monitors, printers, plotters, and voice output.    <br />Monitors Monitors are also called display screen or video display terminals. Most monitors that    <br />sit on desks are built in the same way as television sets, these are called cathode-ray tubes. Another type    <br />of monitor is flat-panel display, including liquid-crystal display (LCD), electroluminescent (EL) display</p>
<p>and gas-plasma display. An LCD does not emit light of its own. Rather, it consists of crystal molecules.   <br />[2]An electric field causes the molecules to line up in a way that alters their optical properties.    <br />Unfortunately, many LCDs are difficult to read in sunlight or other strong light. A gas-plasma display is    <br />the best type of flat screen. Like a neon light bulb, the plasma display uses a gas that emits light in the    <br />presence of an electric current.    <br />Printers There are four popular kinds of printers: dot-matrix, laser, ink-jet, and thermal.    <br />Dot-Matrix Printer Dot-matrix printers can produce a page of text in less than 10 seconds    <br />and are highly reliable. They form characters or images using a series of small pins on a print    <br />head. The pins strike an inked ribbon and create an image on paper. Printers are available with    <br />print heads of 9, 18, or 24 pins. One disadvantage of this type of printer is noise.    <br />Laser Printer The laser printer creates dotlike images on a drum, using a laser beam light    <br />source. [3]The characters are treated with a magnetically charged inklike toner and then are    <br />transferred from drum to paper. A heat process is used to make the characters adhere. The laser    <br />printer produces images with excellent letter and graphics quality.    <br />Ink-Jet Printer An ink-jet printer sprays small droplets of ink at high speed onto the    <br />surface of the paper. This process not only produces a letter-quality image but also permits    <br />printing to be done in a variety of colors.    <br />Thermal Printer A thermal printer uses heat elements to produce images on heat-sensitive    <br />paper. Color thermal printers are not as popular because of their cost and the requirement of    <br />specifically treated paper. They are a more special use printer that produces near photographic    <br />output. They are widely used in professional art and design work where very high quality color is    <br />essential.    <br />Plotters Plotters are special-purpose output devices for producing bar charts, maps, architectural    <br />drawings, and even three-dimensional illustrations. Plotters can produce high-quality multicolor    <br />documents and also documents that are larger in size than most printers can handle. There are four types    <br />of plotters: pen, ink-jet, electrostatic, and direct imaging.    <br />Voice-Output Devices Voice-output devices make sounds that resemble human speech but    <br />actually are pre-recorded vocalized sounds. Voice output is used as a reinforcement tool for    <br />learning, such as to help students study a foreign language. It is used in many supermarkets at the    <br />checkout counter to confirm purchases. Of course, one of the most powerful capabilities is to    <br />assist the physically challenged.</p>
