## Use Git Via SSH

I always use git with https. But today, I found a git repository via https in not available from my country, some problem of the DNS, you understand...

So I have to use ssh. I think it should work, it really be.

My git repository is hosted on gitlab, I have to create a RSA key pair, as I use SourceTree, I can create a key pair via menu tools/Gernerate or import SSH keys
