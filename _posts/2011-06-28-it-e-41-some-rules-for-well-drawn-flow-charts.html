<p>Well-drawn flow charts are easy to read. Here are a few rules for well-drawn flow charts:    <br />Every flowchart has a START symbol and a STOP symbol.     <br />The flow of sequence is generally from the top of the page to the bottom of the page. This     <br />can vary with loops which need to flow back to an entry point.     <br />Use arrow-heads on connectors where flow direction may not be obvious.     <br />There is only one flow chart per page.     <br />A page should have a page number and a title.     <br />A flow chart on one page should not break and jump to another page.     <br />A flow chart should have no more than around 15 symbols (not including START and     <br />STOP).</p>
