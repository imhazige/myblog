<p>Image or Graphic? Technically, neither.[1]If you really want to be strict, computer pictures   <br />are files, the same way WORD documents or <font color="#0000ff">solitaire</font> games are files. They're all a bunch of ones    <br />and zeros all in a row. But we do have to communicate with one another so let's decide.    <br />Image. We'll use &quot;image&quot;. That seems to cover a wide enough topic range.    <br />&quot;Graphic&quot; is more of an adjective, as in &quot;graphic format.&quot; we <font color="#0000ff">denote</font> images on the Internet    <br />by their graphic format. GIF is not the name of the image. GIF is the compression factors used to    <br />create the <font color="#0000ff">raster</font> format set up by CompuServe.    <br />So, they're all images unless you're talking about something specific.    <br />The images produced in Drawing programs (CorelDraw, Illustrator, Freehand, Designer etc)    <br />are called vectorised graphics. [2]That is, all of the objects shown on the computer monitor are    <br />representations of points and their relationship to each other on the work area, each of which is    <br />stored in the computer as simple values and mathematical equations <font color="#0000ff">depicting</font>: the relationship    <br />between each point and the next point referenced to it, and the position (vector) of each point    <br />referenced to a starting corner of the work area.    <br />Bitmap pictures are stored as a vertical and horizontal array of Pixels and stored information    <br />represents the colour of each of these pixels. The resolution of a bitmap picture describes how    <br />many of these pixels exist over a set distance, usually horizontally: ie pixels per inch or pixels per    <br />centimetre. An unaltered bitmap picture of 300 pixels / inch enlarged by 1000% will therefore    <br />still have the same number of pixels across the actual picture area but each represented pixel will    <br />cover a larger area.    <br />[3]At such an enlargement, the picture would be of little use for reproduction unless viewed    <br />from quite a long distance.    <br />Bitmap or Photo-retouching programs are correctly called PAINTING PROGRAMS.    <br />Vectorised drawings on the other hand can be enlarged as much as desired because, although the    <br />above mentioned points on a drawing would be further apart, the relationship of any described line between    <br />the points would always be the same. A single company logo file produced in a Drawing program could be    <br />used for a business card, any <font color="#0000ff">brochure</font> or poster, or <font color="#0000ff">plotting</font> out to a Screen Print <font color="#0000ff">stencil</font> 3 metres (9 feet)    <br />wide, where as bitmap files would have to be created for every size used if practicable.    <br />What is raster, vector, metafile, PDL, VRML, and so forth?    <br />These terms are used to classify the type of data a graphics file contains.    <br />Raster files (also called bitmapped files) contain graphics information described as pixels,    <br />such as photographic images. Vector files contain data described as mathematical equations and</p>
<p>are typically used to store line art and CAD information. Metafiles are formats that may contain   <br />either raster or vector graphics data. Page Description Languages (PDL) are used to describe the    <br />layout of a printed page of graphics and text.    <br />Animation formats are usually collections of raster data that is displayed in a sequence.    <br />Multi-dimensional object formats store graphics data as a collection of objects (data and the code    <br />that manipulates it) that may be rendered (displayed) in a variety of perspectives. Virtual Reality    <br />Modeling Language (VRML) is a 3D, object-oriented language used for describing &quot;virtual    <br />worlds&quot; networked via the Internet and hyperlinked within the World Wide Web. Multimedia file    <br />formats are capable of storing any of the previously mentioned types of data, including sound and    <br />video information.</p>
