<p>这是由<a href="http://freehtml5templates.com/" target="_blank">freehtml5templates.com</a>写的一片关于html5排版的文章，你可以在他的网站上找到许多html5排版的免费模板。</p>
<p>HTML5 Quick Learning Guide    <br />Just what you need to know to quickly     <br />move from HTML / XHTML to HTML5     <br />Brought to you by     <br /><a href="http://freehtml5templates.com/">http://freehtml5templates.com/</a>     <br />Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License     <br />HTML5 syntax is compatible with both HTML4 and XHTML1. Want to close     <br />empty elements with a slash? Go for it. Rather not? Then don't. Want to use     <br />lower case? Upper case? Take your pick. In other words, you really don't have     <br />to change the way you handle these things, so don't worry, ok?     <br />HTML5 doctype is much simpler:     <br />New way:     <br />&lt;!doctype html&gt;     <br />Old ways:     <br />&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;     <br />&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;</a>&gt;     <br />or     <br />&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;     <br />&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;</a>&gt;     <br />Meta charset tag is much simpler:     <br />New way:     <br />&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;     <br />Old way:     <br />&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-     <br />8&quot; /&gt;     <br />Divs are now used for styling rather than structure; HTML5 includes several     <br />new structural elements that help define parts of the document. Let's take a     <br />look at the main new structural elements that you'll probably use right away.     <br />(Note that included in the head is an HTML5 shiv that allows us to style elements in IE,     <br />and a basic CSS style is also included so we can help browsers that aren't caught up yet to     <br />render the new block-level elements as block-level elements. For now, it's easiest just to     <br />automatically include them. Understanding why can come later.)     <br />Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License     <br />Main Structural Elements You'll Use Most Often in HTML5     <br />&lt;header&gt;     <br />&lt;nav&gt;     <br />&lt;section&gt;     <br />&lt;article&gt;     <br />&lt;aside&gt;     <br />&lt;footer&gt;     <br />Although these sound like “positions” in a document, and very often will be     <br />used in that way, they really are about grouping and not positioning. You might     <br />have 3 &lt;sections&gt; in a page, with each &lt;section&gt; having its own &lt;header&gt; and     <br />&lt;footer&gt; for instance. (Note that these elements – like classes – can be used     <br />more than once on a page).     <br />But to keep things simple, for this document's purpose, let's just think of a     <br />very basic document that contains a top header, a menu for navigation, a     <br />content section that contains a couple of articles, a sidebar, and a footer.     <br />In HTML4 or XHTML, you probably would have used divs, classes and ids to     <br />group each of those areas. You can and should still use divs, classes and ids for     <br />styling reasons, but they may no longer be as necessary as before for     <br />structural purposes. Some documents may be able to get by without them     <br />completely, while most will probably still need them for styling. But again, for     <br />the purposes of learning the quick facts to create a simple HTML5 document,     <br />let's keep this really basic.     <br />Here's a simple way to code a very basic document that contains a top header,     <br />a menu for navigation, a content section that contains a couple of articles, a     <br />sidebar, and a footer in HTML5.     <br />Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License     <br />&lt;!doctype html&gt;     <br />&lt;html&gt;     <br />&lt;head&gt;     <br />&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;     <br />&lt;title&gt;Very Basic Document&lt;/title&gt;     <br />&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;<a href="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js&quot;">http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js&quot;</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;     <br />&lt;style&gt;header, footer, section, aside, nav, article {display: block;}&lt;/style&gt;     <br />&lt;/head&gt;     <br />&lt;body&gt;     <br />&lt;nav&gt;     <br />&lt;ul&gt;     <br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     <br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     <br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     <br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Contact Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     <br />&lt;/ul&gt;     <br />&lt;/nav&gt;     <br />&lt;header&gt;     <br />&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Very Basic Document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;     <br />&lt;h2&gt;A tag line might go here&lt;/h2&gt;     <br />&lt;/header&gt;     <br />&lt;section&gt;     <br />&lt;article&gt;     <br />&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;First Article Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;     <br />&lt;img src=&quot;images/flower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flower&quot;&gt;     <br />&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. &lt;/p&gt;     <br />&lt;/article&gt;     <br />&lt;article&gt;     <br />&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Second Article Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;     <br />&lt;img src=&quot;images/tree.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tree&quot;&gt;     <br />&lt;p&gt;Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam.&lt;/p&gt;     <br />&lt;/article&gt;     <br />&lt;/section&gt;     <br />&lt;aside&gt;     <br />&lt;h4&gt;Connect With Us&lt;/h4&gt;     <br />&lt;ul&gt;     <br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     <br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     <br />&lt;/ul&gt;     <br />&lt;/aside&gt;     <br />&lt;footer&gt;     <br />&lt;p&gt;All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;     <br />&lt;/footer&gt;     <br />&lt;/body&gt;     <br />&lt;/html&gt;     <br />Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License     <br />As you can see, the structure is fairly simple, and you can style these new     <br />structural elements in the CSS. However, because you may have some of these     <br />structural elements within different groupings on a page (such as several     <br />sections having different headers and footers), you may want to style each     <br />differently. In that case, you can still assign ids and classes just as you would     <br />in HTML4 or XHTML.     <br />The point of the structural elements is to designate structure after all;     <br />presentation is dealt with in the CSS in whatever manner works best for you,     <br />using ids and classes.     <br />So what are the actual definitions of these new structural elements?     <br />&lt;header&gt; represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. (Things     <br />you'd usually wrap in a H1, H2, Hx, etc)     <br />&lt;nav&gt; represents a section of the document intended for navigation. (Like a     <br />menu)     <br />&lt;section&gt; represents a generic document or application section. It can be     <br />used together with the h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements to indicate the     <br />document structure. (Just a logical grouping such as a content section)     <br />&lt;article&gt; represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as     <br />a blog entry or newspaper article. (Independent is the key word here. If the     <br />piece of content could make sense plucked out of this document and placed     <br />somewhere else, it's probably an article)     <br />&lt;aside&gt; represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest     <br />of the page. (Usually a sidebar, but could be another type of content that     <br />isn't directly related to the main content)     <br />&lt;footer&gt; represents a footer for a section and can contain information about     <br />the author, copyright information, et cetera. (You know, like... a footer)     <br />Of course, HTML5 comes with other interesting elements such as the video and     <br />audio elements, plus new and changed elements and attributes, but all of     <br />those belong in a separate cheat sheet. This one is to get you up and running     <br />fast, so there you have it. Just the basics that will let you quickly move from     <br />HTML4 or XHTML to HTML5 right now!     <br />Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License     <br />If you want to delve into the finer points, I recommend starting with the W3C     <br />draft, entitled HTML5 differences from HTML4 located at     <br /><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/">http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/</a>     <br />This document created by <a href="http://freehtml5templates.com/">http://freehtml5templates.com/</a>     <br />We'd love to have you follow us at <a href="http://twitter.com/html5templates">http://twitter.com/html5templates</a> and     <br />please bookmark and share our site within your social networks (twitter,     <br />facebook, stumbleupon, delicious, etc).     <br />Feel free to share this document with others, keeping in mind that     <br />this document is licensed under the Creative Commons     <br />Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United     <br />States License (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-ncnd/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-ncnd/</a>     <br />3.0/us/).     <br />Share it; don't sell it.

<p>概要:</p>
<p>简明的声明方式</p>
<p>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;    <br />新增结构标签</p>
<p>&lt;header&gt;注意不是&lt;head&gt; </p>
<p>&lt;nav&gt;导航    <br />&lt;section&gt;文档部分，例如第一部分，第二部分     <br />&lt;article&gt;文章，数据应该在这部分显示（Independent数据独立性）     <br />&lt;aside&gt;边，预祝内容无关的元素     <br />&lt;footer&gt;页脚</p>
<p>而div将由原来的排版转向样式用途。</p>
