Some terms often <br />used with networks are: node, client, server, network operating system, distributed processing <br />and host computer. <br />A node is any device that is connected to a network. It could be a computer, printer, or <br />communication or data storage device. <br />A client is a node that requests and uses resources available from other nodes. Typically, a</p> <p>client is a user's microcomputer. <br />A server is a node that shares resources with other nodes. Depending on the resources <br />shared, it may be called a file server, printer server, communication server, or database server. <br />Network operating system likes Windows, it controls and coordinate the activities between <br />computers on a network. These activities include electronic communication, information, and <br />resource sharing. <br />In a distributed processing system, computing power is located and shared at different <br />locations. [1]This type of system is common in decentralized organizations where divisional <br />offices have their own computer systems. The computer systems in the divisional offices are <br />networked to the organization's main or centralized computer. <br />Host computer is a large centralized computer, usually a minicomputer or a mainframe. <br />A network may consist only of microcomputers, or it may integrate microcomputers or <br />other devices with large computers. [2]Networks can be controlled by all nodes working together <br />equally or by specialized nodes coordinating and supplying all resources. Networks may be <br />simple or complex, self-contained or dispersed over a large geographical area. <br />Configuration A network can be arranged or configured in several different ways. The <br />four principal configurations are star, bus, ring, and hierarchical. <br />In a star network, a number of small computers or peripheral devices are linked to a central <br />unit. This central unit may be a host computer or a file server. All communications pass through <br />this central unit. Control is maintained by polling. That is, each connecting device is asked <br />whether it has a message to send. Each device is then in turn allowed to send its message. One <br />particular advantage of the star form of network is that it can be used to provide a time-sharing <br />system. That is, several users can share resources (&quot;time&quot;) on a central computer. The star is a <br />common arrangement for linking several microcomputers to a mainframe that allows access to an <br />organization’s database. <br />In a bus network, each device in the network handles its own communications control. There <br />is no host computer. All communications travel along a common connecting cable called a bus. As <br />the information passes along the bus, it's examined by each device to see if the information is <br />intended for it. The bus network is typically used when only a few microcomputers are to be linked <br />together. This arrangement is common in systems for electronic mail or for sharing data stored on <br />different microcomputers. The bus network is not as efficient as the star network for sharing <br />common resources. (This is because the bus network is not a direct link to the resource.) However, <br />a bus network is less expensive and is in very common use. <br />In a ring network, each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. There is no <br />central file server or computer. Message are passed around the ring until they reach the correct <br />destination. With microcomputers, the ring arrangement is the least frequently used of the four <br />networks. However, it often is used to link mainframes, especially over wide geographical areas. <br />These mainframes tend to operate fairly autonomously. They perform most or all of their own <br />processing and only occasionally share data and programs with other mainframes. A ring</p> <p>network is useful in a decentralized organization because it makes possible a distributed data <br />processing system. That is, computers can perform processing tasks at their own dispersed <br />locations. However, they can also share programs, data and other resources with each other. <br />The hierarchical network consists of several computers linked to a central host computer, <br />just like a star network. However, these other computers are also hosts to other, smaller <br />computers or to peripheral devices. Thus, the host at the top of the hierarchy could be a <br />mainframe. The computers below the mainframe could be minicomputers, and those below, <br />microcomputers. The hierarchical network—also called a hybrid network—allows various <br />computers to share databases, processing power, and different output devices. A hierarchical <br />network is useful in centralized organizations. For example, different departments within an <br />organization may have individual microcomputers connected to departmental minicomputers. <br />The minicomputers in turn may be connected to the corporation’s mainframe, which contains <br />data and programs accessible to all. <br />Strategies </p> <p>Every network has a strategy or way of coordinating the sharing of information <br />and resources. The most common network strategies are peer-to-peer and client/server systems. <br />In a peer-to-peer network system nodes can act as both servers and clients. For example, one <br />microcomputer can obtain files located on another microcomputer and can also provide files to <br />other microcomputers. A typical configuration for a peer-to-peer system is the bus network. <br />Commonly used net operating systems are Apple's Macintosh Peer-to-Peer LANs, Novell’s <br />Netware Lite, and Microsoft's Windows for Workgroups. There are several advantages to using this <br />type of strategy. The networks are inexpensive and easy to install, and they usually work well for <br />smaller systems with less than ten nodes. As the number of nodes increases, however, the <br />performance of the network declines. Another disadvantage is the lack of powerful management <br />software to effectively monitor a large network's activities. For these reasons, peer-to-peer network <br />are typically used by small networks. <br />Client/server network systems use one powerful computer to coordinate and supply services to <br />all other nodes on the network. This strategy is based on specialization. Server nodes coordinate <br />and supply specialized services, and client nodes request the services. Commonly used net <br />operating systems are Novell's Netware, Microsoft's LAN and Windows NT. One advantage of <br />client/server network systems is their ability to handle very large networks efficiently. Another <br />advantage is the powerful network management software that monitors and controls the network's <br />activities. The major disadvantages are the cost of installation and maintenance.</p> <p>1, term&#160; [tə:m] <br /> n. 学期,术语,名词,期限 <br /> v. 称,呼 <br />2, peripheral&#160; [pə'rifərəl] <br />a. 不重要的,外围的 <br />3, hybrid&#160; ['haibrid] <br />n. 杂种，混血儿；混合物 <br />adj. 混合的；杂种的 <br />4, dispersed&#160; [di'spə:st] <br />adj. 散布的；被分散的；被驱散的 <br />v. 分散；传播（disperse的过去分词）</p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-18-network-architecture.html" data-flip="title">it-e-18 Network Architecture</a></p> </article> <article id="post-%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-19-video-conference-and-h-323" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-19-video-conference-and-h-323.html" data-flip="title"> it-e-19 Video Conference and H.323 </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:57:32+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>英语</span> on <span>English</span>, <span>It</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Internet is nowadays widely used in the world, it provides numerous services, such as <br />on-line booking, BtoB (business to business) services, databases accesses to the companies. But <br />all these services are asynchronous, which means that there is a delay between an action from the <br />user and the response from the service (it's a client/server architecture; a computer provides a <br />service which is used by one or several clients). The new generation of network communication <br />tools tries to reach the real time level, which means that there is no delay between the action of <br />the user and the response. <br />Real time chats, or for instance video on demand, are the new services provided by the <br />Internet today. These applications appeared recently and are still in development. One really <br />interesting applications for these technologies is video conference. <br />Video conference is a technology which allows people to communicate through computer <br />networks using an audio stream and a video stream. In a few words, people using video <br />conference can hear and see their correspondents. <br />Video conference has been very popular only over ISDN (dedicated digital phone lines). <br />These days, packet-switched networks, such as IP networks, have opened the door to newer <br />protocols including H.323. The computing power of the desktop systems, the kind of computers <br />that can be found in the companies or at home, allows the use of video conference applications. <br />Moreover, webcams, these little low resolution cameras that can be plugged on a regular <br />computer, are becoming cheaper and cheaper, and almost every computer has now audio <br />capabilities. <br />H.323 is the standard for video conference. It can be used over IP (Internet Protocol), and <br />possibly over all kinds of switched-packet networks (LAN/Local Area Network, MAN/ <br />Metropolitan Area Network, and WAN/Wide Area Network, including the Internet). It was <br />defined by the ITU (it is the leading publisher of telecommunication technology, regulatory and <br />standards information ) in 1996. It is updated almost every year, to fit the new progresses in <br />network capabilities and computing power. The latest version is H.323.5. It was defined in 2003. <br />The scope of H.323 covers real-time voice, video and data communication over packet-switched <br />networks. It has multipoint capabilities (several people can communicate with several other people at <br />the same time) voice and video conferencing capabilities. <br />The H.323 protocol can be defined as an &quot;umbrella&quot; specification, which means that the protocol <br />includes several other protocols. In the H.323, the H.225.0, the H.245, the H.450.x, the T.120 <br />protocols are also defined. In addition to these protocols H.323 uses audio codecs (H.261 and H.263), <br />video codecs (G.711, G.722, G.723.1, G.728 and G.729), and a real-time transport layer called <br />RTP/RTCP (Real-time Protocol and Real-time Control Protocol). All these protocols cover a different <br />aspect of the video conference system. <br />Video conference is one of the most exciting communication media, and will certainly take</p> <p>a bigger and bigger place in our future. H.323 is a mature protocol that can be safely used for this <br />purpose. It is widely used by telecom companies, and offers interesting alternatives to the regular <br />telephone. With the growing power of Internet and the need of world wide communications, <br />there is no doubt that video conference will be tomorrow for our society what telephone is <br />nowadays.</p> <p>1, regulatory&#160; ['regjulətəri] <br />a. 取缔的,统制的,调整的 <br />2, codecs&#160;&#160; <br />n. 多媒体数字信号编解码器（codec的复数形式）</p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-19-video-conference-and-h-323.html" data-flip="title">it-e-19 Video Conference and H.323</a></p> </article> <article id="post-%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-20-browsers-and-communications" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-20-browsers-and-communications.html" data-flip="title"> it-e-20 Browsers and Communications </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:56:39+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>英语</span> on <span>English</span>, <span>It</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>Want to communicate with a friend across town, in another province, or even in another <br />country? The Internet and the WEB are the 21st-Century information resources designed for all <br />of us to use. <br />Browsers are programs that provide access to Web resources. This software connects you to <br />remote computers, opens and transfers files, displays text and images, and provides in one tool an <br />uncomplicated interface to the Internet and Web documents. Two well-known browsers are <br />Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. For browsers to connect to other resources, <br />the location or address of the resources must be specified. These addresses are called Uniform <br />Resources Locators (URLs). Following the Domain Name System (DNS), all URLs have at least <br />three basic parts. The first part presents the protocol used to connect to the resource. The protocol <br />http:// is by far the most common. The second part presents the domain name or the name of the <br />server where the resource is located. The server is identified as www.aol.com. (Many URLs have <br />additional parts specifying directory paths, file names, and pointers.) The last part of the domain <br />name following the dot (.) is the domain code. It identifies the type of organization. For example, <br />com indicated a commercial site. <br />The URL http://www.aol.com connects your computer to a computer that provides <br />information about America Online (AOL). These informational locations on the Web are called <br />Web sites. Moving from one Web site to another is called surfing. <br />Once the browser has connected to a Web site, a document file is sent to your computer. <br />This document contains Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) commands. The browser <br />interprets the HTML commands and displays the document as a Web page. Typically, the first <br />page of a Web site is referred to as its home page. [1]The home page presents information about <br />the site along with references and hyperlinks, or connections to other documents that contain <br />related information such as text files, graphic images, audio, and video clips. <br />These documents may be located on a nearby computer system or on one halfway around <br />the world. The references appear as underlined and colored text and /or images on the Web page. <br />To access the referenced material, all you do is click on the highlighted text or image. A link is <br />automatically made to the computer containing the material, and the referenced material appears. <br />Communication is the most popular Internet activity. The impact of electronic communication <br />cannot be overestimated. At a personal level, friends and family can stay in contact with one another <br />even when separated by thousands of miles. [2]At a business level, electronic communication has <br />become standard and many times preferred way to stay in touch with suppliers, employees, and <br />customers. <br />You can communicate with anyone in the world who has an Internet address or e-mail</p> <p>account with a system connected to the Internet. All you need is access to the Internet and an <br />e-mail program. Two of the most widely used e-mail programs are Microsoft's Outlook Express <br />and Netscape's Navigator. <br />Suppose that you have a friend, Anny, who is going to the University of Southern California. <br />You and Anny have been planning a trip for the upcoming break. You have heard there are some <br />inexpensive airfare deals online. To save money, you and Anny agree to research these offers and <br />e-mail each other your findings. <br />A typical e-mail message has three basic elements: header, message and signature. The <br />header appears first and typically includes the following information: <br />Addresses: Addresses of the persons sending, receiving, and, optionally, anyone else <br />who is to receive copies. <br />Subject: A one-line description, used to present the topic of the message. Subject lines <br />typically are displayed when a person checks his or her mail-box. <br />Attachments: Many e-mail programs allow you to attach files such as documents and <br />worksheets. If a message has an attachment, the file name appears on the attachment <br />line. <br />The letter or message comes next. It is typically short and to the point. Finally, the signature <br />line provides additional information about the sender. Typically, this information includes the <br />sender's name, address, and telephone number. <br />Following the domain name system discussed earlier, e-mail addresses have two basic parts. <br />The first part is the user's name and the second part is the domain name, which includes the <br />domain code. <br />You can also use e-mail to communicate with people you do not know but with whom you <br />wish to share ideas and interests. You can participate in discussions and debates that range from <br />general topics like current events and movies to specialized forums like computer troubleshooting <br />and Star Trek. <br />Mailing lists allow members of a mailing list to communicate by sending messages to a list <br />address. Each message is then copied and sent via e-mail to every member of the mailing list. To <br />participate in a mailing list, you must first subscribe by sending an e-mail request to the mailing <br />list subscription address. Once you are a member of a list, you can expect to receive e-mail from <br />other on the list. You may find the number of messages to be overwhelming. If you want to <br />cancel a mailing list, send an e-mail request to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; to the subscription address. <br />Newsgroups, unlike mailing lists, use a special network of computers called the Usenet. <br />Each of these computers maintains the newsgroups listing. There are over 10,000 different <br />newsgroups organized into major topic areas that are further subdivided into subtopics. <br />Contributions to a particular newsgroup are sent to one of the computers on the Usenet. This <br />computer saves the messages on its system and periodically shares all its recent messages with <br />the other computers on the Usenet. Unlike mailing lists, a copy of each message is not sent to <br />each member of a list. Rather, interested individuals check contributions to a particular</p> <p>newsgroup, reading only those of interest. There are thousands of newsgroups covering a wide <br />variety of topic areas. <br />Chat groups allow direct &quot;live&quot; communication. To participate, you join a chat group, select <br />a channel or topic, and communicate live with others by typing words on your computer. Other <br />members of your channel immediately see those words on their computers and can respond in the <br />same manner. One popular chat service is called Internet Relay Chat (IRC). This software is <br />available free from several locations on the Internet. Using the chat-client software, you log on to <br />the server, select a channel or topic in which you are interested, and begin chatting. To participate, <br />you need access to a server or computer that supports IRC. This is done using special chat-client <br />software. <br />Instant messaging, like chat groups, allows one or more people to communicate via direct, <br />&quot;live&quot; communication. Instant messaging, however, provides greater control and flexibility than <br />chat groups. To use instant messaging, you specify a list of friends, or &quot;buddies&quot;, and register <br />with an instant messaging server. Whenever you connect to the Internet, you use special software <br />to tell your messaging server that you are online too. It notifies you if any of your buddies are <br />online. At the same time, it notifies your buddies that you are online. You can then send <br />messages back and forth to one another instantly. <br />Before you submit a contribution to a discussion group, it is recommended that you observe <br />or read the communications from others. This is called lurking. By lurking, you can learn about <br />the culture of a discussion group. For example, you can observe the level and style of the <br />discussions. You may decide that a particular discussion group is not what you were looking for <br />in which case, unsubscribe. If the discussions are appropriate and you wish to participate, try <br />to fit into the prevailing culture. Remember that your contributions will likely be read by <br />hundreds of people.</p> <p>1, overestimated&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />v. 过高估计；过高评价（overestimate的过去分词） <br />adj. 估计过高的 <br />2, impact&#160; ['impækt] <br />n. 冲击,冲突,影响 <br />v. 挤入,撞击,对...发生影响 <br />3, usenet&#160; [ju:znet] <br />n. 世界性新闻组网络 <br />4, Lurking&#160; ['lə:kiŋ] <br />n. （新用户的）“潜伏”（在USENET上作为旁观者，不参加讨论）</p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-20-browsers-and-communications.html" data-flip="title">it-e-20 Browsers and Communications</a></p> </article> <article id="post-%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-21-what-is-wap" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-21-what-is-wap.html" data-flip="title"> it-e-21 What is WAP </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:56:02+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>英语</span> on <span>English</span>, <span>It</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>(1) Have you heard the hypeabout the wireless Web? <br />Either way, WAP an acronym for wireless application protocol is making the wireless <br />Internet a reality, and even if it isn't successful right now, this industry is expecting enormous <br />growth. Market researcher IDC predicts that 1.3 billion wireless Internet users will have <br />WAP-enabled devices by 2004. <br />(2) Where did WAP come from? <br />An industry consortium called the WAP Forum promotes WAP. The WAP forum was <br />founded in 1997 by Ericson, Motorola, Nokia and Phone.com after Phone.com developed a <br />server and browser for AT&amp;T's PocketNet. <br />(3) What exactly is WAP <br />WAP is a set of protocols used to transfer data to wireless devices. WAP-enabled devices <br />provide wireless users with a limited version of the Web designed to work on the small black and</p> <p>white screens of phones and PADs. <br />Websites accessed by WAP phones must be re-written to satisfy the wireless application <br />protocol; in order to do that, Web pages written in HTML must be transferred to the WAP <br />markup language (WML). Internet browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer read pages in <br />HTML, while a micro-browser on a WAP-enabled device reads pages in WML. <br />Major websites like Yahoo and Amazon.com have carefully designed their WAP sites to <br />look and feel much like their wired counterparts, while search engines like Google are <br />transferring pages from HTML to WML so they can be accessed by wireless users. <br />(4) What's the problem with WAP <br />WAP faces bandwidth constraints that limit the amount of data that can be transferred to the <br />devices. On the wireless Internet, users are presented with a fraction of information available on <br />the traditional version. <br />And while WAP is the leading wireless protocol now, that doesn't mean that isn't here to <br />stay. When a better version of the wireless Web becomes available, WAP could very well <br />become obsolete. <br />One potential competitor is NTT DoCoMo, a Japanese company which has developed a <br />hugely successful wireless data service called i-mode and expects to tap the U.S. market toward <br />the end of 2001. <br />Blue-tooth is a technology that connects electronic devices from camcorders to PDAs to <br />computers without using wires. Consumers began to see Bluetooth in action when Toshiba <br />starting selling a Bluetooth-enabled PC card over their website in September 2000 for $199. <br />Other vendors plan to follow with devices ranging from PDAs to mobile phones. <br />A Bluetooth device uses radio signal to send information from one Bluetooth device to <br />another though the air. For example, if you are trying to transfer a PC's address book to a PDA, <br />first the data in an address book is translated into a language that the PDA can understand by a <br />conduit. The data goes through the conduit to the Bluetooth device. The Bluetooth device is made <br />up of a base-band processor, a radio, and an antenna. The base-band processor transfers the data <br />into signals that the radio can understand, and the radio puts out signals in a frequency (2.4 <br />gigahertz) that the antenna transmits through the air to another Bluetooth device within 30-feet. <br />The other device receives the data and processes it in the reverse order. <br />Bluetooth is supported by a Special Interest Group (SIG), which was founded in 1998 and <br />has approximately 2000 members, all of whom have access to Bluetooth specifications the <br />information needed to make a Bluetooth product. The SIG includes IBM, Intel, Microsoft and <br />Nokia, and works to develop and promote the Blue-tooth technology. <br />But Bluetooth, like many new technologies, may not be an instant hit. There are still plenty <br />of questions about the ability of these devices to speak the same language. So while devices <br />produced by the same company could communicate with each other easily, integration may be</p> <p>difficult when multiple vendors are involved. And while consultants at Forrester Research expect <br />Bluetooth’s popularity to grow, the firm said in a brief that many businesses won't buy in, &quot;until <br />user pressure forces them to in 2003“</p> <p>1, hype&#160; [haip] <br />v. 大肆宣传 <br />2, acronym&#160; ['ækrənim] <br />n. 缩写字,字头语 <br />3, enormous&#160; [i'nɔ:məs] <br />a. 巨大的,庞大的 <br />4, consortium&#160; [kən'sɔ:tjəm] <br />n. 联合,合伙,国际财团 <br />5, obsolete&#160; ['ɔbsəli:t] <br />a. 已废弃的,过时的 <br />6, camcorders&#160; ['kʌmkɔ:də(r)] <br />便携式摄像机,摄录机 <br />7, conduit&#160; ['kɔndit] <br />n.

A VoIP <br />phone allows the user to take advantage of VoIP technology without involving a personal computer, <br />although an Internet connection is required. Physically, a VoIP phone set resembles a traditional <br />hard wired or cordless telephone set. Some VoIP phone sets offer enhanced quality audio, <br />comparable to that on compact disc (CD). A few VoIP phone sets allow for the transmission and <br />reception of image data during calls, so they can be considered video telephones. <br />An IP PBX is a private branch exchange (telephone switching system within an enterprise ) <br />that switches calls between VoIP users on local lines while allowing all users to share a certain</p> <p>number of external phone lines. The typical IP PBX can also switch calls between a VoIP user <br />and a traditional telephone user, or between two traditional telephone user in the same way that a <br />conventional PBX does. With a conventional PBX, separate networks are necessary for voice and <br />data communications. One of the main advantages of an IP PBX is the fact that it employs <br />converged data and voice networks. This means that Internet access, as well as VoIP <br />communications and traditional telephone communications, are all possible using a single line to <br />each user. This provide flexibility as an enterprise grows, and can also reduce long-term <br />operation and maintenance costs. <br />Ear and mouth (E&amp;M) is a technology in voice over IP (VoIP) that uses a traditional <br />telephone handset with an earphone (or earpiece) for listening to incoming audio and a <br />microphone (or mouthpiece) for transmitting audio. Calls using an E&amp;M interface can be made <br />from, received from , or disconnected by a private banch exchange (PBX) as well as from a <br />VoIP-capable computer. <br />The main advantage of E&amp;M is the fact that it allows a PBX to reliably detect disconnect <br />(hang-up) signals. This eliminates problems that can otherwise occur with locked computer ports <br />at the terminations of calls, and thus minimizes the risk of needlessly consuming network <br />resources.</p> <p>cordless ['kɔ:dlis] <a></a></p> <p>n. 不用电线的adj. 无线的（副词cordlessly）</p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-22-voip-phone-and-ip-pbx.html" data-flip="title">it-e-22 VoIP Phone and IP PBX</a></p> </article> <article id="post-%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-23-search-tools" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-23-search-tools.html" data-flip="title"> it-e-23 Search Tools </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:54:59+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>英语</span> on <span>English</span>, <span>It</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>The Web can be an incredible resource providing information on nearly any topic <br />imaginable. Are you planning a trip? Writing an Economics paper? Looking for a movie review? <br />Trying to locate a long-lost friend? Information sources related to these questions, and much, <br />much more are available on the Web. <br />With over two billion pages and more being added daily, the Web is a massive collection of <br />interrelated pages. With so much available information, locating the precise information you <br />need can be difficult. Fortunately, a number of organizations called search services or search <br />providers can help you locate the information you need. They maintain huge databases relating to <br />information provided on the Web and the Internet. The information stored at these databases <br />includes addresses, content descriptions or classifications, and keywords appearing on Web pages <br />and other Internet informational resources. Special programs called agents, spiders, or bots</p> <p>continually look for new information and update the search services databases. Additionally, <br />search services provide special programs called search engines that you can use to locate specific <br />information of the Web. <br />[1]Search engines are specialized programs that assist you in locating information on the Web <br />and the Internet. To find information, you go to the search service's Web site and use their search <br />engine. Yahoo’s search engine, like most others, provides two different search approaches. <br />Keyword Search <br />In a keyword search, you enter a keyword or phrase reflecting the information you want. <br />The search engine compares your entry against its database and returns a list of hits or sites that <br />contain the keywords. Each hit includes a hyperlink to the referenced Web page (or other <br />resource) along with a brief discussion of the information contained at that location. Many <br />searches result in a large number of hits. For example, if you were to enter the keyword travel, <br />you would get over a thousand hits. [2]Search engines order the hits according to those sites that <br />most likely contain the information requested and present the list to you in that order, usually in <br />groups of ten. <br />Directory Search <br />Most search engines also provide a directory or list of categories or topics such as Arts <br />&amp;Humanities, Business &amp; Economics, Computers &amp; Internet. In a directory search, also known <br />as index search. You select a category that fits the information that you want. Another list of <br />subtopics relates to the topic you selected appears. You select the subtopic that best relates to <br />your topic and another subtopic list appears. You continue to narrow your search in this manner <br />until a list of Web sites appears. This list corresponds to the hit list previously discussed. <br />As a general rule, if you are searching for general information, use the directory search <br />approach. For example, to find general information about music, use a directory search beginning <br />with the category Arts &amp;Humanities. If you are searching for specific information, use the key <br />word approach. For example, if you were looking for a specific MP3 file, use a key word search <br />entering the album title and/or the artist’s name in the text selection box. <br />A recent study by the NEC Research Institute found that any one search engine includes <br />only a fraction of the informational sources on the Web. Therefore, it is highly recommended that <br />you use more than one search engine when researching important topics. Or, you could use a <br />special type of search engine called a metasearch engine.&quot; <br />One way to research a topic is to visit the Web site for several individual search engines. At <br />each site, enter the search instructions, wait for the hits to appear, review the list, and visit <br />selected sites. This process can be quite time-consuming and duplicate responses from different <br />search engines are inevitable. Metasearch engines offer an alternative. <br />Metasearch engines are programs that automatically submit your search request to several</p> <p>search engines simultaneously. The metasearch engine receives the results, eliminates duplicates, <br />orders the hits, and then provides the edited list to you. There are several metasearch sites <br />available on the Web. One of the best known is Metacrawler.</p> <p>Specialized search engines focus on subject-specific Web sites. Specialized sites can <br />potentially save you time by narrowing your search. For example, let's say you are researching a <br />paper about the fashion industry. You could begin with a general search engine like Yahoo! Or, <br />you could go to a search engine that specialized specifically in fashion.</p> <p>1, incredible&#160; [in'kredəbl] <br />a. 难以置信的 <br />2, massive&#160; ['mæsiv] <br />a. 巨大的</p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-23-search-tools.html" data-flip="title">it-e-23 Search Tools</a></p> </article> <article id="post-%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-24-understanding-the-world-wide-web" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-24-understanding-the-world-wide-web.html" data-flip="title"> it-e-24 Understanding the World Wide Web </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:54:08+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>英语</span> on <span>English</span>, <span>It</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>it-e-24 Understanding the World Wide Web</p> <p>The World Wide Web is a system of Internet servers that supports hypertext to access <br />several Internet protocols on single interface. The World Wide Web is often abbreviated as the <br />Web or WWW. <br />The World Wide Web was developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee of the European Particle <br />Physics Lab (CERN) in Switzerland. The initial purpose of the Web was to use networked <br />hypertext to facilitate communication among its members, who were located in several counties. <br />Word was soon spread beyond CERN, and a rapid growth in the number of both developers and <br />users ensued. In addition to hypertext, the Web began to incorporate graphics, video and sound. <br />The use of the Web has now reached global proportions.</p> <p>Almost every protocol type available on the Internet is accessible on the Web. Internet</p> <p>protocols are sets of rules that allow for intermachine communication on the Internet. The <br />following major protocols are accessible on the Web: <br />E-mail (Simple Mail Transport Protocol or SMTP): Distributes electronic messages and files <br />to one or more electronic mailboxes <br />Telnet (Telnet Protocol): Facilitates login to a computer host to execute commands <br />FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Transfers text or binary files between an FTP server and client <br />Usenet (Network News Transfer Protocol or NNTP): Distributes Usenet news articles <br />derived from topical discussions on newsgroups <br />HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Transmits hypertext over networks. This is the <br />protocol of the WWW. <br />Many other protocols are available on the Web. To name just one example, the Voice over <br />Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows users to place a telephone call over the Web. <br />The World Wide Web provides a single interface for accessing all these protocols. This creates <br />a convenient and user-friendly environment. It is no longer necessary to be conversant in these <br />protocols within separate command-level environments. The Web gathers together these protocols <br />into a single system. Because of this feature and because of the Web's ability to work with <br />multimedia and advanced programming languages, the World Wide Web is the fastest-growing <br />component of the Internet. <br />The operation of the Web relies primarily on hypertext as its means of information retrieval. <br />HyperText is a document containing words that connect to other documents. These words are called <br />links and are selectable by the user. A single hypertext document can contain links to many <br />documents. In the context of the Web, words or graphics may serve as links to other documents, <br />images, video and sound. Links may or may not follow a logical path, as each connection is <br />programmed by the creator of the source document. Overall, the WWW contains a complex virtual <br />Web of connections among a vast number of documents, graphics, videos and sounds. <br />Producing hypertext for the Web is accomplished by creating documents with a language <br />called HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. With HTML, tags are placed within the text to <br />accomplish document formatting, visual features such as font size, italics and bold, and the <br />creation of hypertext links. Graphics may also be incorporated into an HTML document. HTML <br />is an evolving language, with new tags being added as each upgrade of the language is developed <br />and released. The World Wide Web Consortium, led by Tim Berners-Lee, coordinates the efforts <br />of standardizing HTML. <br />The World Wide Web consists of files called pages or Web pages, containing information <br />and links to resources throughout the Internet. <br />Web pages can be created by user activity. For example, if you visit a Web search engine <br />and enter keywords on the topic of your choice, a page will be created containing the results of</p> <p>your search. In fact, an increasing amount of information found on the Web today is served from <br />databases, creating temporary Web pages &quot;on the fly&quot; in response to user queries. Access to Web <br />pages may be accomplished by: <br />Entering an Internet address and retrieving a page directly. <br />Browsing through pages and selecting links to move from one page to another. <br />Searching through subject directories linked to organized collections of Web pages. <br />Entering a search statement at a search engine to retrieve pages on the topic of your <br />choice. <br />Today's World Wide Web presents an ever-diversified experience of multimedia, programming <br />languages and real-time communication. There is no question that it is a challenge to keep up with the <br />rapid pace of developments. The following presents a brief description of some of the more important <br />trends to watch. <br />The Web has become a broadcast medium. It is possible to listen to audio and video over the <br />Web both pre-recorded and live. For example, you can visit the sites of various news organizations <br />and view the same videos shown on the nightly television news. Several plug-ins are available for <br />viewing these videos. For example, Apple's Quick Time Player downloads files with the .mov <br />extension and displayed these as &quot;movies&quot; in a small window on your computer screen. Quick Time <br />files can be quite large, and it may take patience to wait for the entire movie to download into your <br />computer before you can view it. <br />The problem if slow download times has been answered by a revolutionary development in <br />multimedia capability: Streaming media. In this case, audio or video files are played as they are <br />downloading or streaming into your computer. Only a small wait, called buffering, is necessary <br />before the file begins to play. The RealPlayer plug-in plays streaming audio and video files. <br />Extensive files such as interviews, speeches and hearings work very well with the RealPlayer. <br />The RealPlayer is also ideal for the broadcast of real-time events. These may include press <br />conferences, live radio and television broadcasts, concerts, etc. The Windows Media Player is <br />another streaming media player. Many sites offer the option to use one player or the other. A list <br />of sites that make use of these programs is available on the page, Multimedia on the Web. <br />Shockwave presents another multimedia experience. Shockwave allows for the creation and <br />implementation of an entire multimedia display combining graphics, animation and sound. <br />Sound files, including music, may also be heard on the Web. It is not uncommon to visit a <br />Web page and hear background music. Sound files are also available for downloading <br />independent of Web page visits. Sound files of many types are supported by the Web with the <br />appropriate plug-ins. The MP3 file format, and the choice of supporting plug-ins, is the latest <br />music trend to sweep the Web. The famous Napster site allows for the exchange of MP3 files. <br />Live cams are anther aspect of the multimedia experience available on the Web. Live cams <br />are video cameras that send their data in real time to a Web server. These cams may appear in all</p> <p>kinds of locations, both serious and whimsical: an office, on top of a building, a scenic locale, a <br />special event, and so on. <br />The use of existing and new programming languages has extended the capabilities of the <br />Web. What follows is a basic guide to a group of the more common languages and functions in <br />use on the Web today. <br />CGI, Active Server Pages: CGI (Common Gateway Interface) refers to a specification by <br />which programs can communicate with a Web server. A CGI program, or script, is any program <br />designed to accept and return data that conforms to the CGI specification. The program can be <br />written in any programming language, including C, Perl, and Visual Basic Script. A common use <br />for a CGI script is to process an interactive form on a Web page. For example, you might fill out <br />a form ordering a book through Interlibrary Loan. The script processes your information and <br />sends it to a designated e-mail address in the Interlibrary Loan department. <br />Anther type of dynamically generated Web page is called Active Server Pages (ASP). <br />Developed by Microsoft, ASPs are HTML pages that include scripting and create interactive <br />Web server applications. The scripts run on the server, rather than on the Web browser, to <br />generate the HTML pages sent to browsers. Visual Basic and JScript (a subset of JavaScript) are <br />often used for the scripting. ASPs end in the file extension .asp. <br />Java/Java Applets: Java is probably the most famous of the programming languages of the <br />Web. Java is an object-oriented programming language similar to C++. Developed by Sun <br />Microsystems, the aim of Java is to create programs that will be platform independent. The Java <br />motto is, &quot;Write once, run anywhere.&quot; A perfect Java program should work equally well on a PC, <br />Macintosh, Unix, and so on, without any additional programming. This goal has yet to be <br />realized. Java can be used to write applications for both Web and non-Web use. <br />Web-based Java applications are usually in the form of Java applets. These are small Java <br />programs called from an HTML page that can be downloaded from a Web server and run on a <br />Java-compatible Web browser. A few examples include live newsfeeds, moving images with <br />sound, calculators, charts and spreadsheets, and interactive visual displays. Java applets can tend <br />to load slowly, but programming improvements should lead to a shortened loading time. <br />JavaScript/JScript: JavaScript is a programming language created by Netscape Communications. <br />Small programs written in this language are embedded within an HTML page, or called externally <br />from the page, to enhance the page's the functionality. Examples of JavaScript include moving tickers, <br />drop-down menus, real-time calendars and clocks, and mouse-over interactions. JScript is a similar <br />language developed by Microsoft and works with the company's Internet Explorer browser. <br />VRML: VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) allows for the creation of three-dimensional <br />words. These may be linked from Web pages and displayed with a VRML viewer. Netscape <br />Communicator comes with the Cosmo viewer for experiencing these three-dimensional worlds. One of <br />the most interesting aspects of VRML is the option to &quot;enter&quot; the world and control your movements <br />within the world. <br />XML: XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a Web page creation language that enables</p> <p>designers to create their own customized tags to provide functionality not available with HTML. <br />XML is a language of data structure and exchange, and allows developers to separate form from <br />content. At present, this language is little used as Web browsers are only beginning to support it. <br />In May 1999, however, the W3 Consortium announced that HTML 4.0 has been recast as an <br />XML application called XHTML. This move will have a significant impact on the future of both <br />XML and HTML. <br />Text, audio and video communication can occur in real time on the Web. This capability <br />allows people to conference and collaborate in real time. In general, the faster the Internet <br />connection, the more successful the experience. <br />At its simplest, chat programs allow multiple users to type to each other in real time. <br />Internet Relay Chat and America Online's Instant Messenger are prime examples of this type of <br />program. The development of a messaging protocol is underway. Such a protocol would allow <br />for the expansion of this capability throughout the Internet. <br />More enhanced real-time communication offers an audio and/or video component. CU-See <br />Me is one of the most popular software programs of this type. Even more elaborate are programs <br />that allow for true real-time collaboration. Microsoft's NetMeeting and Netscape's Conference <br />(available with Communicator) are good examples of this. <br />Featured collaboration tools include: <br />audio: conduct a telephone conversation on the Web; <br />video: view your audience; <br />file transfer: send files back and forth among participants; <br />chat: type in real time; <br />whiteboard: draw, mark up, and save images on a shared window or board. <br />document/application sharing: view and use a program on another's desktop machine. <br />collaborative Web browsing: visit Web pages together. <br />Currently no standard exists that will work among all conferencing programs. <br />Push: Push refers to a technology that sends data to a program without the program's request. <br />This is the opposite of the typical &quot;pull&quot; of the Web, in which the user clicks on a link to request <br />a file from a server. With push, the data is sent automatically. Content is sent through a &quot;channel&quot;. <br />The early Web-based implementation of push was commercial. Push can also be used to deliver <br />software upgrades to a desktop machine.</p> <p>1, facilitate&#160; [fə'siliteit] <br />v. 帮助,使...容易,促进 <br />2, proportions&#160; [prə'pɔ:ʃəns] <br />n. 比例；大小（proportion的复数形式） <br />3, retrieval&#160; [ri'tri:vəl] <br />n. 取回,恢复,修补 <br />4, diversified&#160; [dai'və:sifaid, di-] <br />adj. 多样化的；各种的 <br />v. 使…多样化（diversify的过去分词） <br />5, whimsical&#160; ['(h)wimzikəl] <br />a. 心情浮动的,反覆无常的,古怪的 <br />6, conduct&#160; ['kɔndʌkt, -dəkt] <br />n. 行为,举动,品行 <br />vt. 引导,指挥,管理 <br />vt. 导电，传热 <br />7, commercial&#160; [kə'mə:ʃəl] <br />a. 商业的 <br />n. 商业广告 </p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-24-understanding-the-world-wide-web.html" data-flip="title">it-e-24 Understanding the World Wide Web</a></p> </article> <article id="post-%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-25-rosettanet" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-25-rosettanet.html" data-flip="title"> it-e-25 RosettaNet </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:53:25+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>英语</span> on <span>English</span>, <span>It</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>Remember the promise of the paperless office? Computers communicating electronically with <br />one another were going to replace the tons of paperwork that characterized business-to-business <br />interaction: purchase orders, invoices, payments, confirmations, documentation. The list was nearly <br />endless. Electronic document interchange (EDI) was going to be the savior or our systems and <br />protector of our forests. <br />It didn't happen. EDI never met the challenges of connecting scores of proprietary and <br />mission-critical applications. Now a new success of is stepping up to the challenge. <br />RosettaNet is both a set of standards and a global consortium of more than 500 electronic <br />components, IT and semiconductor manufacturing companies working to create, implement and <br />promote open e-business process standards. Founded in 1998, RisettaNet aims to align specific <br />business processes among trading partners by defining and standardizing up to 100 e-business</p> <p>transaction processes so that two companies' back-end systems can talk directly to each other. <br />RosettaNet takes its name from the Rosetta stone, which a soldier in Napoleon's army <br />discovered in Egypt in 1799. Since it contained parallel inscriptions in both Greek characters and <br />Egyptian hieroglyphics, it provided a key to deciphering ancient Egyptian writing. <br />This modern electronic translator speaks the contemporary languages of computer interoperability <br />XML and SOAP <br />which should allow disparate systems and business processes from different <br />organizations to understand and exchange data with one another. <br />The consortium began its Herculean task by looking at supply chain processes. Members used <br />business-process modeling to identify the elements of a working business process and create a <br />clearly defined model of current trading partner interfaces. After extensively researching every level <br />of the supply chain, as well as analyzing misalignments and inefficiencies, they developed a set of <br />generic, standardized processes that could serve as the basis for real-world business-to-business <br />alignment. <br />These Partner Interface Processes (PIP) are specialized system-to-system, XML-based <br />dialogues. Each PIP specification includes a business document and a detailed business process <br />that includes interaction, data transmission, security and error-handling requirements. <br />PIPs use two data dictionaries <br />one for business properties and another for technical properties <br />that help different companies define the same produce in exactly the same way. The Rosettanet <br />Implementation Framework defines an exchange protocol, and the Message Guidelines instruct <br />implementers on how to encode individual PIPs into specific packages. <br />Such efforts at standardizing generic processes have been tried before and failed. RosettaNet, <br />however, seems more carefully grounded in the real world, and its PIPs are tested by consortium <br />members. After consortium partners have agreed through a voting process that a PIP meets <br />industry needs, it is then published on the RosettaNet Web site and is available for anyone to use.</p> <p>1, invoice&#160; ['invɔis] <br />n. 发票,发货单,货物 <br />v. 开发票,记清单 <br />2, inscriptions&#160; [in'skripʃən] <br /> n. 题字,碑铭 <br />3, deciphering&#160;&#160;&#160; <br />解密 <br />4, misalignment&#160; ['misəlainmənt] <br />n. 不重合；未对准 </p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-25-rosettanet.html" data-flip="title">it-e-25 RosettaNet</a></p> </article> <article id="post-web/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93/2011/05/25/ipv6-%e5%bd%b1%e5%93%8dmysql%e8%bf%9e%e6%8e%a5can-not-connect-to-mysql-10061" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/web/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93/2011/05/25/ipv6-e5-bd-b1-e5-93-8dmysql-e8-bf-9e-e6-8e-a5can-not-connect-to-mysql-10061.html" data-flip="title"> ipv6 影响mysql连接,can not connect to mysql 10061 </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:52:46+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>Web</span> / <span>数据库</span> on <span>Mysql</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>之前mysql都可以连，今天安装了ipv6后就连不上了。报错can not connect to mysql 10061</p> <p>卸载了ipv6后重启机器，再连就可以了。必须要卸载才行，禁用ipv6不起作用。</p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/web/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93/2011/05/25/ipv6-e5-bd-b1-e5-93-8dmysql-e8-bf-9e-e6-8e-a5can-not-connect-to-mysql-10061.html" data-flip="title">ipv6 影响mysql连接,can not connect to mysql 10061</a></p> </article> <article id="post-%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-26-definitions-and-content-of-the-electronic-commerce" class="post mb6" role="article"> <header> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-26-definitions-and-content-of-the-electronic-commerce.html" data-flip="title"> it-e-26 Definitions and Content of the Electronic Commerce </a> </h1> <p class="post-date heading"> <time datetime="2011-05-25T16:52:04+08:00">25 May 2011</time> in <span>英语</span> on <span>English</span>, <span>It</span> </p> <div class="hr" style="padding-bottom:0"></div> </header> <p>Electronic Commerce over the Internet is a new concept. In recent years, it has become so <br />broadly used that it is often left undifferentiated from other current trends which rely on <br />automation, such as concurrent engineering and just in time manufacturing. Many companies, <br />including CyberCash, Dig Cash,First Virtual, and Open Market had provided a variety of <br />electronic commerce services. <br />[1] If you have access to a personal computer (PC) and can connect to the Internet with a <br />browser, you can do business online. No more worries about programming. No more searching <br />for outdated catalogs as a customer or printing catalogs as a merchant. No more looking for <br />phone numbers, paying long-distance to connect, or keeping the store open late into the evening. <br />Just get on the Web, open an online store, and watch your business grow. <br />The wired world of business, developed technology, human talent, and a new way of doing <br />business make up today's growing worldwide economy. The backbone of this electronic <br />commerce is the Internet. The wired world is not about technology, it is about information, <br />decision making and communication. The wired world is changing life for everyone, from the <br />single household to the largest corporation. [2]No business can afford to ignore the potential of a <br />connected economy. <br />Electronic commerce is anemergingconcept that describes the process of buying and</p> <p>selling or exchanging of products, services, and information via computer networks including the <br />Internet. Kalakota and Whinston (1997) define EC from these perspectives: <br />From a communications perspective, EC is the delivery of information, products/services, or <br />payments over telephone lines, computer networks, or any other electronic means. <br />From a business process perspective, EC is the application of technology toward the <br />automation of business transactions and work flow. <br />From a service perspective, EC is a tool that addresses the desire of firms, consumers, and <br />management to cut service costs while improving the quality of goods and increasing the speed <br />of service delivery. <br />From an on-line perspective, EC provides the capability of buying and selling products and <br />information on the Internet and other on-line services. <br />The term commerce is viewed by some as transactions conducted between business partners. <br />Therefore, the term electronic commerce seems to be fairly narrow to some people. Thus, many <br />use the term e-business. It refers to a broader definition of EC, not just buying and selling but <br />also servicing customers and collaborating with business partners, and conducting electronic <br />transactions within an organization. According to Lou Gerstner, IBM's CEO: &quot;E-business is all <br />about cycle time, speed, globalization, enhanced productivity, reaching new customers and <br />sharing knowledge across institutions for competitive advantage.&quot; <br />Just like any other type of commerce, electronic commerce involves two parties: businesses <br />and consumers. There are three basic types of electronic commerce. <br />Business-to-Consumer (B2C): These areretailingtransactions with individual shoppers. The <br />typical shopper at Amazon.com is a consumer, or a customer. Oftentimes, this arrangement <br />eliminates the middleman by providing manufacturers direct sales to customers. Other times, <br />retail stores create a presence on the Web as another way to reach customers. <br />Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C): This category involves individuals selling to individuals. <br />This often takes the form of an electronic version of the classified ads or anauction. Goods are <br />described and interested buyers contact sellers tonegotiateprices. [3]Unlike traditional sales via <br />classified ads and auctions, buyers and sellers typically never meet face-to-face. Examples are <br />individuals selling in classified ads and selling residential property, cars, and so on. Advertising <br />personal services on the Internet and selling knowledge and expertise is another example of C2C. <br />Several auction sites allow individuals to put items up for auctions. Finally , many individuals are <br />using internal networks to advertise items for sale or service. <br />Business-to-Business (B2B): This category involves the sale of a product or service from <br />one business to another. This is typically a manufacturer-supplier relationship. For example, a <br />furniture manufacturer requires raw materials such as wood, paint, andvarnish. In B2B electronic <br />commerce, manufacturers electronically place orders with suppliers and many times payment is <br />made electronically. <br />Many people think EC is just having a Web site, but EC is much more than that. There are <br />dozens of applications of EC such as home banking, shopping in on-line stores and malls, buying</p> <p>stocks, finding a job, conducting an auction, and collaborating electronically on research and <br />development projects. To execute these applications, it is necessary to have supporting information <br />and organizational infrastructure and systems. EC applications are supported by infrastructures, and <br />their implementation is dependent on four major areas: people, public policy, technical standards <br />and protocols, and other organizations. The EC management coordinates the applications, <br />infrastructures, andpillars.</p> <p>1, merchant&#160; ['mə:tʃənt] <br />n. 商人,店主 <br />a. 商业的 <br />2, emerge&#160; [i'mə:dʒ] <br />v. 浮现,(由某种状态)脱出,(事实)显现出来 <br />3, retailing&#160; ['ri:teiliŋ] <br />n. 零售业 <br />4, auction&#160; ['ɔ:kʃən] <br />vt. 拍卖；竞卖 <br />n. 拍卖 <br />5, negotiate&#160; [ni'gəuʃieit] <br />v. 商议,谈判,交涉 <br />6, varnish&#160; ['vɑ:niʃ] <br />n. 油漆,掩饰,光泽面 <br />v. 粉饰,涂油漆于 <br />7, pillars&#160;&#160; <br />n. 栋梁</p> <p class="read-more">Continue reading <a class="heading" href="/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/2011/05/25/it-e-26-definitions-and-content-of-the-electronic-commerce.html" data-flip="title">it-e-26 Definitions and Content of the Electronic Commerce</a></p> </article> <h2 class="sr-only">Pagination</h2> <nav class="pagination heading" role="navigation"> <ul> <li class="pagination-item older" > <a rel="next" href="/page-66/">Older</a> </li> <li class="pagination-item newer" > <a rel="prev" href="/page-64/">Newer</a> </li> </ul> </nav> <footer> <hr/> <p>© 2011 - 2017.
